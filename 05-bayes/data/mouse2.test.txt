 E-GEOD-55307 - Gene profiling in CBA and BL/6 bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDC) Analysis of baseline gene expression in bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDC) from female CBA/J  (CBA) and C57BL/6 (BL/6) mice.      Results provide insight into strain-dependent differences in gene expression.     CBA and BL/6 BMDCs prepared from individual mice were plated in replicate at 1x10^6 cells/ml in 48-well tissue culture plates (BD Falcon). Replicates were pooled after 4hr and total RNA was obtained by Trizol® (Invitrogen) extraction according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
 E-GEOD-21507 - Constitutively active Stat3 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) is considered as an oncogene being constitutively activated in a wide variety of primary human tumours, which often become addicted to its activity.     Using primary fibroblasts derived from a knock-in mouse expressing only the constitutively active form STAT3-C as well as STAT3-dependent tumor cell lines MDA-MB468, DU145 and SKBR3, we provide evidence that STAT3 can act as a central regulator of cell metabolism.     STAT3C/C  MEFs are resistant to apoptosis and senescence and they show reduced mitochondrial activity but activate aerobic glycolysis, as shown by enhanced expression of master regulators of glycolysis such as PDK-1 and HIF-1α, and by increased lactate production, glucose avidity and sensitivity to glycolysis inhibitors.     HIF-1α is up-regulated in the STAT3C/C  MEFs and is responsible for the glycolytic phenotype.     Moreover, inhibition of STAT3 activity in STAT3-addicted tumour cell lines restores mitochondrial activity and down-regulates glycolytic metabolism, preceding the induction of massive apoptosis.     Thus, the essential role observed for STAT3 in so many different cancer cell types may be partly explained by its ability to act as a molecular switch of cellular metabolism triggering abnormal cell survival/proliferation.     Three biological replicates of MEFs from mice with constitutively active Stat3 are compared to three biological replicates of wild-type MEFs.
 E-GEOD-25257 - Expression data from wild-type and Zmpste24-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) at an early passage (passage 3, P3) Zmpste24 is a metalloproteinase processing prelamin A into mature lamin A, a nuclear structure protein.     Zmpste24-/- mice which accumulate prelamin A in cells recapitulate accelerated aging phenotypes observed in human premature aging disorder, Hutchinson Gilford progeria sydrome (HGPS). Zmpste24-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibited genomic instabiliy and accelerated aging at cellular level, which is premature senescence.     We performed microarray analysis on Zmpste24-/- MEFs, compared to wild-type littermates' MEFs, at an early passage (P3), which is a pre-symptom stage before cellular senescence occurs in the mutant MEFs, in order to examine gene expression profile and figure out the underneath mechanism triggering the premature aging process.     Early passage wild-type and Zmpste24-/- MEFs were collected for RNA extraction, the quality of RNAs were determinded by Electrophoresis Assay (2100 Bioanalyzer, Agilent) and RNA extractions were used for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
 E-GEOD-49894 - A transcriptional and metabolic signature of primary aneuploidy is present in chromosomally-unstable cancer cells and informs clinical prognosis In all primary cells analyzed to date, aneuploidy is associated with poor proliferation.      Yet, how abnormal karyotypes affect cancer – a disease characterized by both aneuploidy and heightened proliferative capacity – is largely unknown.      Here, I demonstrate that the transcriptional alterations caused by aneuploidy in primary cells are also present in chromosomally-unstable cancer cell lines, but are not common to all aneuploid cancers.      Moreover, chromosomally-unstable cancer lines display increased glycolytic and TCA-cycle flux, as is also observed in primary aneuploid cells.      The biological response to aneuploidy is associated with cellular stress and slow proliferation, and a 70-gene signature derived from primary aneuploid cells is a strong predictor of increased survival in several cancers.      Inversely, a transcriptional signature derived from clonal aneuploidy in tumors correlates with high mitotic activity and poor prognosis.      I speculate that there are two types of aneuploidy in cancer: clonal aneuploidy, which is selected during tumor evolution and is associated with robust growth, and sub-clonal aneuploidy, which is caused by chromosomal instability (CIN) and more closely resembles the stressed state of primary aneuploid cells.      Nonetheless, CIN is not benign: a subset of genes upregulated in high-CIN cancers predict aggressive disease in human patients in a proliferation-independent manner.     The mRNAs from 3 different mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) lines that are chromosomally stable were compared with mRNAs from 3 different MEF lines that were chromosomally unstable due to mutations in either BUBR1 or CDC20
 E-GEOD-18064 - Comparison of MBT/Pas and BALB/cByJ MEFs response after infection with Rift Valley Fever virus The Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is an arthropod-borne disease present in several countries of Africa and Middle East.     It is caused by RVF virus which can infect both humans and animals.     In humans, it leads to various manifestations including hepatitis, encephalitis and death, while in domestic animals it usually causes miscarriage in pregnant females and it is often fatal for the newborn.     Not all people or animal infected by the virus present the same disease.     Some patients exhibit unapparent or moderate febrile reactions, while others develop severe symptoms.     This observation suggests that host genetic factors play a role in controlling the outcome of infection.     In this work, we compare the response of two different inbred strains of mice, MBT/Pas and BALB/cByJ, to infection with RVF virus.     These strains exhibit different profiles of susceptibility to RVF virus infection.     Indeed, MBT/Pas mice rapidly develop high viraemia and die soon after infection, while BALB/cByJ mice have a lower viraemia and die later.     Interestingly, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) obtained from MBT/Pas foetuses allows higher viral production than BALB/cByJ MEFs.  Keywords: expression profiling The experiment was designed to include ARN samples from MBT/Pas and BALB/cByJ MEFs infected with the Rift Valley Fever (RVF) virus, and their respective mock-infected controls; each one of those in triplicate.     Therefore, we have used 12 different samples for the study, divided as follows: 3 samples of RVF virus-infected BALB/cByJ MEFs, 3 samples of mock-infected BALB/cByJ MEFs, 3 samples of RVF virus-infected MBT/Pas MEFs and 3 samples of mock-infected MBT/Pas MEFs. Each RNA was extracted from a different culture well.
 E-MEXP-1975 - Transcription profiling by array of mouse dermal fibroblasts after treatment with hydrogen peroxide Mouse dermal fibroblasts exposed to 0, 10 and 50mM of Hydrogen peroxide
 E-GEOD-15325 - Transcription profiling by array of wild type, K-ras mutant, Wt1-null, and double K-ras mutant/Wt1-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts K-ras is one of the most frequently mutated human oncogenes.      Activation of K-ras can lead to either senescence or proliferation in primary cells.     The precise mechanism governing these distinct outcomes remains unclear.     Here we utilized a loss-of-function screen to assess the role of specific genes identified as potential key regulators of K-ras driven oncogenesis.     Using this approach, we identify the transcription factor Wt1 as an inhibitor of senescence in primary cells expressing oncogenic K-ras.      Deletion or suppression of Wt1 expression leads to senescence of primary cells expressing oncogenic K-ras under the control of the native promotor at physiological levels, but has no effect on cells expressing wild-type K-ras.      Wt1 contributes to K-ras driven lung tumorigenesis in vivo and loss of Wt1 is specifically deleterious to human lung cancer cell lines that are dependent on oncogenic K-ras.      Taken together, these observations reveal a novel role for Wt1 as a key regulator of the complex genetic network required for the oncogenic effect of the small GTPase K-ras.       We compare the expression profiles of Wild type, K-ras mutant, Wt1-null, and double K-ras mutant/Wt1-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). The study provides insights into the transcriptional role of Wt1 in the context of oncogenic K-ras.     MEFs were infected with adenoviral Cre to activate K-ras (6 samples), knockout Wt1 (5 samples), both activate K-ras and knockout Wt1 (7 samples). As a control, MEFs were infected with adenoviral GFP (5 samples).  RNA was isolated using Trizol 7 days after infection.     RNA was further prepared by passage over an RNeasy column.     cDNA synthesis, biotinylation of cRNA and hybridization to mouse Genechip 430A v2 containing 39,000 probes was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix, Santa Clara). Microarray data was normalized with Expression Console software (Affymetrix, Santa Clara) using RMA algorithms.
 E-GEOD-27982 - Transcription profiling by array of mouse immortalized embryonic fibroblasts to identify genes regulated by mTORC1 Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) is a critical regulator of cell growth by integrating multiple signals (nutrients, growth factors, energy and stress) and is frequently deregulated in many types of cancer.     We used a robust experimental paradigm involving the combination of two interventions, one genetic and one pharmacologic to identify genes regulated transcriptionally by mTORC1. In Tsc2+/+, but not Tsc2-/- immortalized mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), serum deprivation downregulates mTORC1 activity.     In Tsc2-/- cells, abnormal mTORC1 activity can be downregulated by treatment with rapamycin (sirolimus). By contrast, rapamycin has little effect on mTORC1 in Tsc2+/+ cells in which mTORC1 is already inhibited by low serum.     Thus, under serum deprived conditions, mTORC1 activity is low in Tsc2+/+ cells (untreated or rapamycin treated), high in Tsc2-/- cells, but lowered by rapamycin; a pattern referred to as a low/low/high/low or LLHL, which allowed the identification of genes regulated by mTORC1 by performing the appropriate comparisons
 E-GEOD-26762 - Expression and functional validation of new p38α transcriptional targets in tumorigenesis p38α MAP kinase plays an important tumor suppressor role, which is mediated by both its negative effect on cell proliferation and its pro-apoptotic activity.     Surprisingly, most tumor suppressor mechanisms coordinated by p38α have been reported to occur at the post- translational level.     This contrasts with the important role of p38α in the regulation of transcription and the profound changes in gene expression that normally occur during tumorigenesis.     We have analyzed whole genome expression profiles of Ras-transformed wild- type and p38α-deficient cells and have identified 202 genes that are potentially regulated by p38α in transformed cells.     Expression analysis has confirmed the regulation of these genes by p38α in tumors, and functional validation has identified several of them as likely mediators of the tumor suppressor effect of p38α on Ras-induced transformation.     Interestingly, about 10% of the genes that are negatively regulated by p38α in transformed cells contribute to EGF receptor signalling.     Our results suggest that inhibition of EGF receptor signalling by transcriptional targets of p38α is an important function of this signalling pathway in the context of tumor suppression.     We have investigated how transcriptional regulation contributes to the tumor suppressor effect of p38α, by comparing whole-genome expression profiles of wild-type (WT) and p38α- deficient (p38α-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) expressing oncogenic H-RasG12V
 E-GEOD-59542 - DNA methylation changes in fetal germ cells exposed to endocrine disruptors and in the next generation [methylation set 2] According to recent reports, exposure to environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDs) during pregnancy may harm multiple subsequent generations.     We hypothesized that EDs must directly alter DNA methylation and/or transcription in the exposed fetal germ cells to affect the grandchild.     In addition, the aberrant pattern must be retained in the germ cells of the grandchild -- withstanding global epigenome remodeling -- to affect the great-grandchild.     To test this hypothesis, we extensively searched for immediate and persistent epigenetic effects in purified germ cells of the exposed fetus and those of the next generation.     We treated gestating female mice with previously validated doses of vinclozolin (VZ), bisphenol A (BPA), di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), or control oil, during the time when the prospermatogonia of the exposed fetus undergo global de novo DNA methylation.     Using genome-wide assays, we detected changes in transcription and DNA methylation in the exposed prospermatogonia but these did not persist into the prospermatogonia of the next generation.     There was no evidence for transgenerational inheritance of these epigenetic aberrations.     Our results suggest that EDs exert direct epigenetic effects in the exposed fetal germ cells, but the germline corrects against deleterious effects in the next generation.     Pregnant mice were gavaged daily with endocrine distruptors (VZ at 100 mg/kg/day, DEHP at 750 mg/kg/day, BPA at 0.2 mg/kg/day or control oil) starting at 12.5 days post coitum (dpc) and the G1R germ cells were purified from the exposed fetuses at 17.5 dpc.     The G2R germ cells were purified from fetuses that were sired by males that had been treated in utero in a G0 mother.     G1R spermatozoa were collected from adult males that had been treated in utero at the fetal stages.     G2R spermatozoa were collected from adult males who were sired by in-uteo-treated males.
 E-GEOD-44087 - Gene expression profiling of mouse uterine epithelial cells isolated on morning of day 4 of pregnancy Embryo implantation into a receptive endometrium is tightly regulated by a variety of maternal factors, including cytokines, growth factors and transcription factors.     Previous studies identified the leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), produced in uterine glands, as an essential factor for implantation.     It was shown that LIF acts via its cell surface receptor to activate the transcription factor STAT3 in the uterine epithelial cells.     However, the mechanisms via which STAT3 promotes uterine receptivity remain unknown.     To address the molecular pathways regulated by STAT3 in the uterus, we created mice in which Stat3 gene is conditionally inactivated in uterine epithelium.     These mutant mice are infertile due to implantation failure and exhibit a lack of embryo attachment to the luminal epithelium.     Gene expression profiling of the epithelial tissue impaired in STAT3 activation revealed dysregulated expression of specific components of junctional complexes, including E-cadherin, β-catenin, and claudins, which critically regulate epithelial cell polarity and embryo attachment.     Additionally, mice lacking functional epithelial STAT3 showed markedly reduced stromal proliferation and differentiation, indicating that this transcription factor controls stromal function via a paracrine mechanism.     The stromal defect arose from a drastic reduction in the production of several members of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family in luminal epithelium of mutant uteri and consequent lack of activation of EGF receptor signaling and mitotic activity in the stromal cells.     Collectively, our results uncovered intricate signaling networks operating downstream of STAT3 in uterine epithelium that regulate epithelial cell polarity, and stromal proliferation and differentiation, which are critical determinants of successful implantation.     To identify the downstream targets of STAT3 in mouse uterine epithelial cells during pregnancy, we performed gene expression profling of mouse uterine epithelial cells on day 4 of pregnancy between Stat3 flox control and SW d/d mice.     This led to the identification of several junctional molecules (Claudins and Catenins) that are negatively regulated by STAT3 at the time of implantation.     Mouse uteirne epithelial cells were isolated from control and knockout mice on the morning of day 4 of pregnancy.     (n=3 for each sample), pooled total RNA from these cells was then hybridized to high density affymetrix microarrays according to the Affymetrix protocol (Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 Array) .
 E-MEXP-3748 - Transcription profiling by array of mouse embryonic stem cells overexpressing let-7, miR-99a or both during the early stages of cardiac differentiation To investigate the function of miR99a/let-7c miRNAs during cardiomyogenesis, we decided to perturb their expression using transgenic mES cell lines the corresponding precursors (pre-miRNA) of the two miRNAs. We used the ROSA-TET system (EB3 tet off), in which the transgene is inserted in Rosa26 locus by Cre recombinase.     We generated three different clones both miRNAs let-7c/miR-99a and those only one miRNA, namely  the let-7cdeletedmiR-99a and the miR-99adeletedlet-7c.

 E-GEOD-18125 - Epigenetic regulation of Bmp2 and Smad6 in Ras-induced senescence Epigenetically silenced Ink4a-Arf locus is activated by loss of H3K27me3 in cellular senescence, where secreted factor expression is also involved.     Here we analyzed epigenome and transcriptome alteration during Ras-induced senescence using mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF). Seventeen genes with H3K27me3 loss and H3K4me3 gain showed marked upregulation, including p16Ink4a and Bmp2, a secreted factor for BMP/SMAD signal.     Smad6, specific BMP/SMAD pathway inhibitor, was identified as the only one gene showing de novo H3K27 trimethylation with H3K4me3, resulting in strong repression.     Ras-activated cells senesced with SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation, and they escaped from senescence with decreased SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation when introducing Smad6 or knocking-down Bmp2. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were established from 13.5 embryonic day embryos of C57/B6. After cells were passaged twice (MEFp2), cells were infected with retroviruses for 48 hours.     Then cells were exposed to 4 μg/mL peuromycin for selection during days 0-3, and were passed on days 3, 7, and 10. Retroviral vectors for Ras was constructed by cloning cDNAs for wild type HRAS (RasG12) and mutated HRAS (RasV12) by reverse-transcription PCR products from HMEC and SK-BR3 cell RNA, respectively, with N-terminal FLAG tag into pMX vector that contains puromycin resistance gene.     Mock pMX vector (mock), and vectors containing RasG12 and oncogenic RasV12 were transfected into plat-E packaging cells using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche, Germany) to prepare retroviruses.     Smad6 cDNA with N-termainal 6x Myc tag was also cloned into pMX vector.     To knock down Bmp2, double strand oligonucleotide DNA to express small hairpin RNA against Bmp2 (shBmp2) was cloned into RNAi-Ready pSIREN-RetroQ Vector (Clontech, CA). Viral packaging for Smad6 and shBmp2 retrovirus vectors was also done using plat-E cells.     For genome-wide transcription analysis, GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (Affimetrix) was used.     For global normalization, the average signal in an array was made equal to 100. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing was performed.     MEFp2 cells and cells with mock, RasG12 or RasV12 infection at day 10 were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and were prepared for ChIP. ChIP using anti-H3K4me3 (ab8580, abcam, rabbit polyclonal) or H3K27me3 (07-142, Upstate, rabbit polyclonal) antibody was performed as described previously.     Sample preparation for ChIP-sequencing was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Ilumina), and sequencing was performed using Solexa Giga sequencer.
 E-GEOD-63821 - Effect of embryo in vitro culture on mESC transcriptome. Transcriptome analysis of mouse embryonic stem cell lines derived from embryos cultured in optimal and suboptimal conditions compared to cell lines derived from control embryos.     The use of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) has resulted in the birth of more than 5 million children.     While children conceived by these technologies are generally healthy, there is conflicting evidence suggesting an increase in adult-onset complications like glucose intolerance and high blood pressure in IVF children.     Animal models indicate similar potential risks.     It remains unclear what molecular mechanisms may be operating during in vitro culture to predispose the embryo to these diseases.     One of the limitations faced by investigators is the paucity of the material in the preimplantation embryo to test for molecular analysis.     To address this problem, we generated mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) from blastocysts conceived after natural mating  (mESCFB) or after IVF, using optimal (KSOM + 5% O2; mESCKAA) and suboptimal (Whitten’s Medium, + 20% O2, mESCWM) conditions.     We analyzed three female cell lines per group for a total of nine mouse embryonic stem cells on Affymetrix MoGene 1.0 ST Arrays.
 E-GEOD-19011 - Roles of mammalian Rap1 in TERT recruitment to chromatin, subtelomeric gene silencing and transcriptional regulation Repressor-activator protein 1 (scRap1) is the major binding activity at Saccharomyces cerevisiae telomeres, with roles in telomere length regulation and establishment of subtelomeric silencing by recruiting the Sir proteins.     scRap1 also acts as a transcription factor controlling the expression of ribosomal proteins and glycolytic enzymes.     A homolog of scRap1 exist in mammals, Rap1 (also known as Terf2ip), however, its roles in telomere biology and transcriptional regulation are largely unknown.     We have employed microarrays to obtain gene expression signatures related to Rap1-deleted mice when compared to the wild-type.     Construction of the Rap1 targeting vector:  The strategy for disrupting the Rap1 locus was designed to conditionallty delete exon 3 (E3) through a Cre-mediated excision.     Deletion of E3 leads to the removal of coding sequences encoding for the RCT domain and the NLS sequence, as well as the whole 3’UTR region and poly-adenylation signal (Fig.1A,B). Deletion of E3 was expected to destabilize the Rap1 transcript and thereby to prevent translation of any truncated RAP1 protein.     The targeting vector contains homology regions isogenic with the ES cell line used (129Sv/Pas). The short homology region (SA) harbors a 2.4 kb DNA fragment encompassing exon 2 (E2) and intron 2 (Fig. 1A). The long homology region (LA) is a 5.6 kb DNA fragment downstream the end of E3 (Fig. 1A). The central part contains E3 flanked by two loxP sites and a positive selection neomycin gene (PGK-Neo) flanked by two Frt sites (Fig. 1A). At the 3’-end of the LA a Diphteria Toxin (DTA) selection marker was cloned (Fig. 1A). The vector contains a unique NruI linearization site.     The targeting vector was quality controlled by sequencing of the coding exons, the junctions between the homology arms and the selection cassettes, the selection cassettes and the junctions between the homology arms and the plasmid backbone.     The analysis of the sequencing results showed no polymorphis between the C57BL/6 and 129Sv/Pas genetic background within the isolated Rap1 sequences.     The sequence of the primers used for the PCR amplification of the different targeting vector parts and the details of the cloning steps are available upon request.     The construction of the targeting vector was performed by genOway (www.genoway.com; Lyon, France).  Generation of conditional Rap1 knockout mice  129Sv/Pas ES cells were transfected with 40 µg of linearized plasmid.     Positive selection was started 48 hours after electroporation by addition of 200 µg/ML G418. Approximately 230 positive resistant clones were isolated and amplified.     They were PCR screened for homologous recombination first at the 5’ end of the Rap1 locus.     The 6 positive identified 5’ targeted ES cells were further investigated by PCR amplification over the 3’ long homology arm to amplify the region of the targeted locus containing the distal loxP site.     The direct sequencing of the PCR products amplified from the 6 ES clones revealed that 3 of them contained the distal loxP site.     The recombinant clones identified by PCR were further verified by Southern blot analysis of AflII and PciI restricted genomic DNA using a 5’-internal and a 3’-external probes, respectively (data not shown). The Southern blots confirmed the correct homologous integration over the 5’ and the 3’ homology arm and the absence of any additional randomly integrated copies of the targeting vector.     Chimeric mice were generated by microinjection of three independently targeted ES clones into C57BL/6J host blastocyst.     The resulting offspring showed a high level of chimerism as shown by coat color, and were mated to C57BL/6J mice to assess germ line transmission.     The resulting heterozygous Rap1+/flox-Neo mice were then bred to transgenic mice expressing the Flpe recombinase (Rodriguez et al., 2000) to induce excision of the Neo marker.     The Rap1+/flox heterozygous mice were then intercrossed to generate Rap1flox/flox, and Rap1+/flox mice.     Homozygous Rap1flox/flox mice were crossed with transgenic mice expressing the Cre recombinase under the control of the keratine 5 promoter (Tarutani et al., 1997) (Fig. 5A). Heterozygous Rap1+/D K5-Cre were crossed either to Rap1flox/flox or Rap1+/flox to generate Rap1Δ/Δ K5-Cre. The removal of exon 3 by Cre-mediated recombination was confirmed by PCR analysis using primers F and R (Fig. 1A,C and Fig. 5A). Amplification of the wild type, flox and knockout alleles renders a 3.2 kb, 3.3 kb and 0.5 kb fragments, respectively.      The breeding to the F1 generation and characterization of heterozygous Rap1+/flox-Neo F1 animals was performed by geneOway (www.genoway.com; Lyon, France). All mice were generated and maintained at the Spanish National Cancer Centre (CNIO) under specific pathogen-free conditions in accordance with the recommendation of the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations.
 E-GEOD-37958 - Microarray analysis of gene expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) by addition of serum from L/MDR irradiated mice at 10 and 20 days. The expression changes were detected by addition of serum form L/MDR irradiated mice at 10 and 20 days in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).

 E-GEOD-59539 - DNA methylation changes in fetal germ cells exposed to endocrine disruptors and in the next generation [methylation set 1] According to recent reports, exposure to environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDs) during pregnancy may harm multiple subsequent generations.     We hypothesized that EDs must directly alter DNA methylation and/or transcription in the exposed fetal germ cells to affect the grandchild.     In addition, the aberrant pattern must be retained in the germ cells of the grandchild -- withstanding global epigenome remodeling -- to affect the great-grandchild.     To test this hypothesis, we extensively searched for immediate and persistent epigenetic effects in purified germ cells of the exposed fetus and those of the next generation.     We treated gestating female mice with previously validated doses of vinclozolin (VZ), bisphenol A (BPA), di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), or control oil, during the time when the prospermatogonia of the exposed fetus undergo global de novo DNA methylation.     Using genome-wide assays, we detected changes in transcription and DNA methylation in the exposed prospermatogonia but these did not persist into the prospermatogonia of the next generation.     There was no evidence for transgenerational inheritance of these epigenetic aberrations.     Our results suggest that EDs exert direct epigenetic effects in the exposed fetal germ cells, but the germline corrects against deleterious effects in the next generation.     Pregnant mice were gavaged daily with endocrine distruptors (VZ at 100 mg/kg/day, DEHP at 750 mg/kg/day, BPA at 0.2 mg/kg/day or control oil) starting at 12.5 days post coitum (dpc) and the G1R germ cells were purified from the exposed fetuses at 17.5 dpc.     The G2R germ cells were purified from fetuses that were sired by males that had been treated in utero in a G0 mother.     G1R spermatozoa were collected from adult males that had been treated in utero at the fetal stages.     G2R spermatozoa were collected from adult males who were sired by in-uteo-treated males.
 E-GEOD-54256 - Expression data from primary mouse hepatocytes treated with Diclofenac Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is an important clinical problem.     Here we used a genomics approach to establish the critical drug-induced toxicity pathways that act in synergy with the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor  (TNF) to cause cell death of liver HepG2 cells.     Transcriptomics of the cell injury stress response pathways initiated by two hepatoxicants, diclofenac and carbamazepine, revealed the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress/translational initiation signaling and Nrf2 antioxidant signaling as two major affected pathways, which was similar to that observed for the majority of ~80 DILI compounds in primary human hepatocytes.     The ER stress was primarily related to PERK and ATF4 activation and subsequent expression of CHOP, which was all independent of TNFα signaling.     Identical ATF4 dependent transcriptional programs were observed in primary human hepatocytes as well as primary precision cut human liver slices.     Targeted RNA interference studies revealed that while ER stress signaling through IRE1α and ATF6 acted cytoprotective, activation of the ER stress protein kinase PERK and subsequent expression of CHOP was pivotal for the onset of drug/TNF-induced apoptosis.     While inhibition of the Nrf2-dependent adaptive oxidative stress response enhanced the drug/TNF cytotoxicity, Nrf2 signaling did not affect CHOP expression.     Both hepatotoxic drugs enhanced expression of the translational initiation factor EIF4A1, which was essential for CHOP expression and drug/TNF-mediated cell killing.     Our data support a model in which enhanced drug-induced translation initiates PERK-mediated CHOP signaling in an EIF4A1 dependent manner, thereby sensitizing towards caspase-8-dependent TNF induced apoptosis.     4 biological  replicates of Diclofenac and 6 biological replicates of vehicle.      46 hours after isolation, cells were exposed to either 300 µM DCF or the solvent DMSO for 24 hours.
 E-GEOD-55809 - Cell autonomous and non-autonomous interactions of a western-style diet and the vitamin D receptor in intestinal homeostasis and tumorigenesis These data suggest that co-culture with macrophages increases expression of NDRG-1 in epithelial cell lines.      The finding is confirmed in 2 human epithelial cell lines, and in tissue derived from mice genetically and dietetically altered to increase macrophage infiltration of the small and large intestinal epithelium.      NDRG1 is identified as a potential mediator of macrophage effects on tumorigenesis in the large and small intestine.     Array data is part of a larger study involving the effects of Vitamin D, in concert with macrophages, on intestinal homeostasis and tumorigenesis.     Cells from mouse epithelial cell line CT26 were cultured either alone, or with RAW macrophages in a system which allowed no physical contact but exchange of soluble factors between the cell types.      The experiment was peformed twice.
 E-GEOD-30783 - Prenatal Arsenic Exposure Alters Gene Expression in the Adult Liver to a Proinflammatory State Contributing to Accelerated Atherosclerosis Developmental exposures play a role in adult onset chronic disease.     The mechanisms by which environmental toxicants alter developmental processes predisposing individuals to chronic disease are not understood.     arsenic exposure via drinking water causes cancer and cardiovascular disease.     Transplacental arsenic exposure accelerates and exacerbates atherosclerosis in ApoE-knockout mice.     The liver plays a central role in the interlinked diseases diabetes, metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis.     The hypothesis that accelerated atherosclerosis is a consequence of altered hepatic development was investigated by microarray profiling of mRNA and microRNA abundance in livers isolated from 10 week old (PND70) and newborn (PND1) mice exposed or not exposed to arsenic from day 8 post-fertilization to birth.     The results show that arsenic exposure alters the trajectory of both mRNA and microRNA expression as mice age.     A 51-gene signature of arsenic exposure in both PND1 and PND70 mice was identified.     Pathway Architect analysis of this signature identified nodes of interaction including Hspa8, IgM and Hnf4a. Gene ontology analysis of arsenic exposure-altered mRNAs indicated that pathways for gluconeogenesis and glycolysis were suppressed in PND1 mice and pathways for protein export, ribosome, antigen processing and presentation, and complement and coagulation cascades were induced in PND70 mice.     Analysis of promoters of differentially expressed genes identified enriched transcription factor binding sites and cluster analyses revealed groups of genes sharing sets of transcription factor binding sites suggesting common regulation.     Srebp1 binding sites are present in ~1/6 of the genes differentially expressed in PND70 livers.     Western blot analyses of PND70 liver proteins showed that the inducible form of heat shock protein 70 (Hspa1, Hsp70) and the active form of Srebp1 were induced in arsenic-exposed mice as were plasma AST and ALT levels.     These results suggest that transplacental ar Samples from three frozen livers from each group (newborn exposed and unexposed, 10 week old exposed and unexposed), and from separate litters, were homogenized and total RNA purified using mirVANA RNA pufification kits (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA). RNA was quantitated and intergrity determined on a Nanochip using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Microarray analyses for miRNAs abundance in total liver RNAs was performed by Exiqon (Woburn, MA) using two-color design against mouse standard total RNA (Ambion, now part of Applied Biosystems) and Exiqon LNA 1500 microarrays.     Microarray analyses for mRNA abundance was performed using 2 color design against mouse standard total RNA (Stratgene, LaJolla, CA) and 44k arrays produced at the NIA . The processed data on Exiqon LNA-1500 are attached as a Series supplementary file.     The data are based on the same samples as described in Agilent data submitted here.     The supplementary data includes only the murine miRNA data on the array because these are the only data supplied by Exiqon.     The relationship between GEO's sample names here (Agilent data) and column heads of spreadsheets (Exiqon data) are described in the first sheet of supplemental file: Project Summary Report Heather Miller 01042009 MTE.xls
 E-GEOD-19309 - Dkk4 and Eda regulate distinctive developmental mechanisms for subtypes of mouse hair-1 Dkk4 transgenic mice in wild-type background showed abnormal hair subtype formation.     Gene expression profiling showed significant down regulation of hair follicle-related keratin genes and hair keratin-associated protein genes at E18.5 and P1.  Keywords: development or differentiation design,genetic modification design To define target genes of Dkk4 during hair follicle development, we  carried out microarray experiments with mouse back skin samples that from 4  developmental time points including E14.5, E16.5, E18.5 and P1 of wild-type and wild-type background Dkk4 transgenic mice.
 E-GEOD-38509 - Gene expression profiling in the reprogramming process It remains unclear how the ectopic expression of defined transcription factors induces dynamic changes in gene expression profiles that establish a pluripotent state during direct cell reprogramming.     In the present study, we first identified a temporal gene expression program during the reprogramming process.     Promoter analyses then predicted the role of two forkhead box transcription factors, Foxd1 and Foxo1, as mediators of the gene expression program.     Knockdown of Foxd1 or Foxo1 reduced the number of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The knockout of Foxd1 prevented the downstream transcription program, including the expression of reprogramming marker genes.     Interestingly, the expression level of Foxd1 was also transiently increased in a small population of cells in the middle stage of reprogramming.     The presence or absence of Foxd1 expression in this stage was correlated with a future cell fate as iPSCs or non-reprogrammed cells.     These results suggest that Foxd1 is a mediator and indicator of the successful progression of the gene expression program in cell reprogramming.     Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were infected with retroviruses encoding either the four transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc) or GFP (control) at day 0 and sampled on the indicated days.     Two replicates each.
 E-GEOD-57472 - Target genes of BRG1 in mouse embryonic stem cells BRG1-SWI/SNF complex is an important chromatin remodeling complex that involved in various biological processes.     Here we described the genome-wide binding of histone acetylation upon BRG1 depletion in mouse embryonic stem cells.     Mouse embryonic stem cells were treated with either scrambled siRNA or siRNA against BRG1 for 48 h, and each treatment has three replicates.
 E-GEOD-77843 - RAS signalling through PI3-Kinase controls cell migration via modulation of Reelin expression RAS signalling through Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-Kinase) has been shown to have an essential role in tumour initiation and maintenance.     RAS also regulates cell motility and tumor invasiveness, but the role of direct RAS binding to PI3-Kinase in this remains uncertain.     Here, we provide evidence that disruption of RAS interaction with PI3-Kinase p110adecreases cell motility and prevents activation of Rac GTPase.     Analysis of gene expression in cells lacking RAS interaction with p110areveals increased levels of the extracellular matrix glycoprotein Reelin and activation of its downstream pathway resulting in upregulation of E-Cadherin expression.     Induction of the Reelin / E-Cadherin axis is also observed in Kras mutant lung tumours that are regressing due to blockade of RAS interaction with PI3-Kinase.     Furthermore, loss of Reelin correlates with decreased survival of lung and breast cancer patients.     Reelin thus plays a role in restraining RAS and PI3-kinase promotion of cell motility and potentially tumour metastasis.     MEFs with or without RAS binding to p110a were seeded in a 10cm dish and left to attach during 24 hours.     Full serum media was then removed and media with no FBS was added to the plates.     Starvation was carried out during a period of 16 hours (over night starvation). Assay was performed in triplicates: for each genotype two diferent fibroblasts clones (and a mix of both of the clones) were used on the analysis.     After starvation RNA was extracted using RNAsy kit (Quiagen). RNA was quantified and sent to Oxford Gene Technology microarray facility.
 E-GEOD-38412 - Identification of genes regulated by knockdown of HSF1 or RPA1 Transcription factor access to regulatory elements is prevented by the nucleosome.     Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is a winged helix transcription factor that plays roles in control and stressed conditions by gaining access to target elements, but mechanisms of HSF1 access have not been well known in mammalian cells.     We show a physical interaction between the wing motif of human HSF1 and replication protein A (RPA), which is involved in DNA metabolism.     Depletion of RPA1 abolishes HSF1 access to the promoter of HSP70 in unstressed conditions, and delays its rapid activation in response to heat shock.     The HSF1-RPA complex leads preloading of RNA polymerase II and opens chromatin structure by recruiting a histone chaperone FACT. Furthermore, this interaction is required for melanoma cell proliferation.     These results provide a mechanistic basis for constitutive HSF1 access to nucleosomal DNA, which is important for both basal and inducible gene expression.     To examine whether the HSF1-RPA complex regulates the expression of genes, mRNA levels in MEFs with/without HSF1- or RPA1-shRNA were analyzed by DNA microarray analysis using GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays (Affymetrix).

 E-GEOD-44650 - Diethyl maleate inhibits MCA+TPA transformed cell growth via modulation of GSH, MAPK, and cancer pathways Murine or human cancer cells have high glutathione levels.     Depletion of the elevated GSH inhibits proliferation of cancer cells.     Molecular basis for this observation is little understood.     In an attempt to find out the underlying mechanism, we reproduced these effects in transformed C3H10T1/2 and BALB/c 3T3 cells using diethyl maleate and studied cytogenomic changes in the whole mouse genome using spotted 8 × 60K arrays.     Transformed cells revealed an increase in GSH levels.     GSH depletion by DEM inhibited the growth of transformed cells.     The non-cytotoxic dose of DEM (0.25 mM) resulted in GSH depletion, ROS generation, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, decrease in anchorage independent growth, gene expression changes and activation of all three members of the MAPK family.     Increase in intracellular GSH levels by GSHe countered the effect of DEM. These results support the physiological importance of GSH in regulation of gene expression for transformed cell growth restraint.     This study is of interest in not only understanding the molecular biology of the transformed cells, but also in identifying new targets for development of gene therapy together with the chemotherapy.

 E-GEOD-25331 - Initiation Pausing of 80S Ribosome on mRNA Is Governed by 5’UTR and Responsive to mTORC1 Signaling (Microarray) Recent studies have revealed that the mRNA translation is punctuated by ribosomal pauses through the body of transcripts.      However, little is known about its physiological significance and regulatory aspects.      Here we present a multi-dimensional ribosome profiling approach to quantify the dynamics of initiation and elongation of 80S ribosomes across the entire transcriptome in mammalian cells.      We show that a subset of transcripts have a significant pausing of 80S ribosome around the start codon, creating a major barrier to the commitment of translation elongation.      Intriguingly, genes encoding ribosome proteins themselves exhibit an exceptionally high initiation pausing on their transcripts.      Our studies also reveal that the initiation pausing is dependent on the 5’ untranslated region (5’ UTR) of mRNAs and subject to the regulation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1).  Thus, the initiation pausing of 80S ribosome represents a novel regulatory step in translational control mediated by nutrient signaling pathway.     Untreated TSC2 WT MEFs, TSC2 KO MEFs and TSC2 WT MEFs, TSC2 KO MEFs treated with 20nM rapamycin for 30 minutes or 3hours were harvested for ribosme profiling.     The fraction samples were pooled into three groups based on velocity sedimentation: single ribosome fraction (Small group), fractions with 2 ~ 4 ribosomes (Medium group), and the one with ≥5 ribosomes (Large group). RNA were extracted from the whole cell lysis and each fraction group.
 E-GEOD-27701 - Genes Express in Catalase Overexpression MAECs Study the global genes expression in mouse aorta endothelial cells (MAECs) overexpressing human catalase (hcatTg). The wild type and overexpressing human catalase (hcatTg) MAECs grown to 80% confluence in six-well plates were made quiescent in serum-free DMEM for 12 h and then cultured in 10% FBS DMEM for 12 h.  Total RNA was extracted with Trizol® reagent and purified by Rneasy Mini kit.     Two independent wild type and two hcatTg total RNA samples were performed microarray with GeneChip® Mouse gene 1.0 ST array (Affymetrix, USA).

Expression assay was performed using the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST array.     The experiment includes ß-catenin flox/-, ß-catenin null and ß-catenin null Eα mouse embryonic stem cells with three biological replicates for each sample.
 E-GEOD-18602 - Microglia in ischemic brain injury Microglia are resident CNS immune cells that are active sensors in healthy brain and versatile effectors under pathological conditions.     Cerebral ischemia induces a robust neuroinflammatory response that includes marked changes in the gene expression and phenotypic profile of a variety of endogenous CNS cell types (astrocytes, neurons, microglia) as well as an influx of leukocytic cells (neutrophils, macrophages, T-cells) from the periphery.     Many molecules and conditions can trigger a transformation of “resting” (or surveying) microglia to an “activated” (alerted/reactive) state.     Here we review recent developments in the literature that relate to microglial activation in the experimental setting of in vitro and in vivo ischemia.     We also present new data from our own laboratory demonstrating the direct effects of in vitro ischemic conditions on the microglial phenotype and genomic profile.     Emphasis is placed on the role of specific molecular signaling systems such as hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) in regulating the microglial response in this setting.     We then review histological and recent novel radiological data that confirms a key role for microglial activation in the setting of ischemic stroke in humans.     We discuss recent progress in the pharmacological and molecular targeting of microglia in acute ischemic stroke.     Finally, we explore how recent studies on ischemic preconditioning have increased interest in preemptively targeting microglial activation in order to reduce stroke severity.     12 arrays, 4 experimental groups, 3 replicates in each group, CN is control normoxia, CH is control hypoxia, TN is TLR4 knockout normoxia, TH is TLR4 knockout hypoxia.
 E-GEOD-73612 - Gene expression analysis of inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 (IP6K1) knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts To investigate the biological significance of IP6K1 function we compared the gene expression profile of two mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines each derived from Ip6k1+/+ and Ip6k1-/- embryos.     Results reveal downregulation of several biological processes upon the loss of IP6K1. Organism : Mus musculus , Agilent Gene Expression Whole Genome Mouse 4x44k (AMADID: 14868).

 E-MTAB-1679 - Transcription profiling by array of embryonic stem cells from mutant Map3k1 mice in comparison to control EL14 cells to investigate molecular mechanisms regulating MAPK signaling in embryonic stem cells Transcriptional profiling of gene expression of embryonic stem cells from mutant Map3k1 mice in comparison to control EL14 cells.     The differential expression of specific genes between the mutant and control groups generated from the microarray will give an idea of the molecular mechanisms regulating MAPK signaling in embryonic stem cells.
 E-GEOD-45019 - Gene expression changes induced by overexpression of IDH1mut in the sorted mouse bone marrow cells Mutations in the enzymes IDH1 and IDH2 have been identified in a wide variety of tumors like glioma, chondrosarcoma, thyroid cancer, lymphoma, melanoma, and in acute myeloid leukemia.     Mutated IDH1/2 produces the metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), which interferes with epigenetic regulation of gene expression, and thus may promote tumorigenesis.     HoxA9 immortalized bone marrow cells from C57BJ/6 mice were transduced with either empty vector or pSF91-IDH1wt-IRES-EGFP, or pSF91-IDH1mut-IRES-GFP and transplanted in irradiated recipient mice.     Four weeks after transplantation, GFP+ cells were sorted from mouse bone marrow, from which total RNA was extracted and subjected to microarray analysis.
 E-GEOD-47441 - Induction of pluripotency in mouse somatic cells with novel factors (expression) For years, reprogramming factors that induce pluripotency have been identified primarily from ESC-enriched factors, pluripotency-associated factors such as Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc, Nanog, Esrrb, Sall4, Utf1, Lin28, PRDM14, and Tet2. Through genome-wide screen we identified novel regulators of reprogramming.     Our study is the first proof-of-principle report to suggest a putative general mathematical model.     This model provides novel mechanistic insight into the fundamental understanding of the establishment of cellular identity during programming and reprogramming.     Through genome-wide screen to identify novel factors of reprogramming in addition to Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, cMyc Through genome-wide screen to identify novel factors of reprogramming in addition to Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, cMyc.

 E-GEOD-60295 - The G protein-coupled pH-sensing receptor OGR1 is a regulator of intestinal inflammation OGR1 is a pH sensing G protein-coupled receptor involved in intestinal homeostasis and inflammation.     Up-regulation of genes, mediated by OGR1, in response to extracellular acidification were enriched for inflammation, immune response, actin cytoskeleton and cell adhesion pathways.     Microarray profiling was performed to compare global gene expression of Ogr1 KO and WT residential peritoneal macrophages in response to an acidic pH shift (pH 6.7, 24 h)
 E-GEOD-32347 - FoxA1 regulates sweat secretion through Best2 and Nkcc1 ion transporters Body temperature is maintained in a narrow range in mammals, primarily controlled by sweating.     In humans, the dynamic thermoregulatory organ, comprised of 2-4 million sweat glands distributed over the body, can secrete up to 4 liters of sweat per day1, thereby making it possible to withstand high temperatures and run long distances.     The genetic basis for sweat gland function, however, is largely unknown.     We find that a forkhead transcription factor, FoxA1, is required to generate mouse sweating capacity.     When FoxA1 is ablated, mice are otherwise healthy and sweat gland morphogenesis occurs, but no sweating ensues, with the Nkcc1 sodium/potassium/chloride co-transporter and a specialized Ca2+-activated bicarbonate channel protein, Best2, both sharply down-regulated, and glycoprotein accumulating in gland lumens and ducts.     Furthermore, Best2 knockout mice display comparable anhidrosis and glycoprotein accumulation.     These findings link earlier observations that both sodium/potassium/chloride exchange and Ca2+ are required for sweat production.      FoxA1 is inferred to regulate two corresponding features of sweat secretion.      One, via Best2, catalyzes a bicarbonate gradient that could help to drive calcium-associated ionic transport; the other, requiring Nkcc1, facilitates monovalent ion exchange into sweat.     These mechanistic components can be pharmaceutical targets to defend against hyperthermia and alleviate defective thermoregulation in the elderly2, and may provide a model relevant to more complex secretory processes.     For expression profiling of FoxA1, hairless fore footpad skin (6) was collected from FoxA1 knockouts and wild-type littermates at P10, P14 and P31. Three skin samples from 3 embryos for each genotype at each time point were used for biological replicates.     Total RNAs were isolated with Trizol (Invitrogen), precipitated by 7.5M LiCl (Ambion), and cyanine-3-labeled cRNAs were hybridized to the NIA Mouse 44K Microarray v3.0  (Agilent Technologies). Triplicate data were analyzed by ANOVA (6). Genes with FDR 0.05, fold difference 1.5 and mean log intensity 2.0 were considered to be significant.
 E-GEOD-19938 - Expression data from mouse collecting duct cell, mpkCCD, in response to a peptide hormone vasopressin analog, dDAVP Vasopressin is the major hormone that regulates renal water excretion.      It does so by binding to a receptor in renal collecting duct cells, triggering signaling pathways that ultimately regulate the abundance, location, and activity of the water channel protein aquaporin 2.  We took an advantage of quantitative large scale proteomic technologies and oligonucleotide microarrays to quantify steady state changes in protein and transcript abundances in response to vasopressin in a collecting duct cell line, mpkCCD clone 11 (Yu et al. PNAS 2009, 106:2441-2446).  This cell line originally developed by Alan Vandewalle’s group recapitulates vasopressin-mediated AQP2 expression and phosphorylation as seen in native colleting duct cells.     The mpkCCD cells were grown on membrane supports to permit polarization.      Once transepithelial resistance reached 5kohm per centimeter square and higher, the cells were exposed to the vasopressin V2 receptor analog, dDAVP, at a physiological concentration, 0.1nM, for 5 days.      Control experiments were done with cells exposed to vehicle alone.      Total RNA was harvested and processed for transcript expression analysis using Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays.      Each experimental treatment, vehicle and dDAVP, was repeated 3 times.
 E-GEOD-29139 - Identification of  response genes upon neuronal activation in mouse cortical neurons We search for developmental changes specific to humans by examining gene expression profiles in the human, chimpanzee and rhesus macaque prefrontal and cerebellar cortex.     In both brain regions, developmental patterns were more evolved in humans than in chimpanzees.     The major human specific genes in prefrontal cortex was enriched in neuronal functions and regulated by several transcription factors, which were previously implicated in regulation of neuronal functions.     To confirm neuronal function of the human prefrontal cortex specific genes, we identifed response genes upon neuronal activation in mouse cortical neurons.     Our results show that human specific genes are enriched in the response genes upon neuronal activation, implying the function of human prefrontal cortex specific genes in synaptic development.     The cortical neurons from E15 mouse were isolated and cultured.     We then exposed neurons to bicuculline (Bic), or potassium chloride (KCl), or without treatment.     The cultured neurons under each group were hybridized to Agilent whole mouse genome oligo microarray (4x44k).
 E-GEOD-31423 - Zscan4 transiently reactivates early embryonic genes during the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells Part B The generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by the forced expression of defined transcription factors in somatic cells holds great promise for the future of regenerative medicine.     However, due to a poor understanding of the initial reprogramming mechanism, it is difficult to control the efficiency and quality of the iPSCs. Here we show that Zscan4, expressed transiently in 2-cell embryos and embryonic stem cells (ESCs), efficiently produces iPSCs from mouse embryo fibroblasts when coexpressed with Klf4, Oct4, and Sox2. Unlike other factors, Zscan4 is required only for the first few days of iPSC formation.     Microarray analysis revealed transient and early induction of preimplantation-specific genes in a Zscan4-dependent manner.     Our work indicates that Zscan4 is a previously unidentified potent natural factor that facilitates the reprogramming process through the recapitulation of the early embryonic program.     V6.5 ES cells derived from an F1 hybrid strain (C57BL/6 x 129/Sv) were purchased from Thermo Scientific Open Biosystems.      ES cells were cultured at 37C in 5% CO2 in a complete ES medium: DMEM, 15% FBS, 1000 U/ml LIF (ESGRO, Chemicon), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 2 mM GlutaMAX, 0.1 mM   -mercaptoethanol, penicillin, and streptomycin.     V6.5 ES cells (5x105 cells) in suspension were cotransfected with 2   g of a linearized pCAG-Zscan4-ERT2 vector and 0.4   g of a PL452 vector (Liu et al., 2003) (a neomycin-resistant gene driven by a PGK promoter) using the Effectene (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer   s protocol, and plated in 100 mm cell culture dishes.     After selecting with G418 for 8 days, resulting ES cell colonies were picked, expanded, and frozen.     Subsequently, an ES-ZERT cell clone was selected based on the results of genotyping, qPCR, and puromycin-resistance.     ES-ZERT cells (10-15 cells) were injected into 2N blastocysts and then transferred to E2.5 recipient females.     After genotyping the pups, ZERT chimeric mice carrying pCAG-Zscan4-ERT2 DNA were established.
 E-GEOD-51777 - Expression data from Gprc5a wild type or knockout mouse tracheal epithelial cells (MTECs) Gprc5a is a lung tumor suppressor gene.     Gprc5a-knockout (ko) mice can develop spontaneous lung cancer and Gprc5a-ko mouse model is relevant to human lung cancer.     Thus, exploration of the mechanisms underlying lung tumorigenesis in Gprc5a-ko mice would be very helpful for revealing those in human lung cancer.     We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression profile that underlies oncogenesis by Gprc5a-knockout gene deletion in mouse tracheal epithelial cells.     Wild type and gene-knockout mouse tracheal epithelial cells that were divided into two groups were used for RNA extraction.
 E-GEOD-25310 - Genome-wide identification of Ago2 binding sites from mouse embryonic stem cells with and without mature microRNAs MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a large family of 19-22nt non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate their mRNA targets.     Computational algorithms predict that over half of all genes are regulated by miRNAs, yet approaches for experimental identification of miRNA binding sites are now emerging.      To directly identify endogenous miRNA binding sites, we performed photo-crosslinking immunoprecipitation using antibodies against Ago2, followed by deep-sequencing of RNA tags (CLIP-seq) in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We also performed parallel CLIP-seq in Dicer null mESCs that lack mature miRNAs, allowing us to define whether the association of Ago2 with the identified sites was mediated by miRNAs. We include the exon-array expression data obtained from three sets of Dicer WT and Dicer Null mESCs.These data are used to determine genes that are differentially expressed between Dicer WT and Dicer Null conditions.     Six samples (3 Dicer wild-type CLIP RNA libraries representing two biological replicates, 2 Dicer null CLIP RNA libraries, 1 short-RNA library from Dicer wild-type mESCs) were analyzed.     Six total mESC samples were analyzed (3 Dicer WT, 3 Dicer Null). Expression values for probesets were summarized into a single per-gene value.     The log fold change for Dicer WT/Dicer Null was defined as the difference between the mean expression in Dicer WT mESCs and the mean expression in the Dicer Null mESCs.
 E-GEOD-56252 - The reprogramming of tumor stroma by HSF1 is a potent enabler of malignancy Stromal cells within the tumor microenvironment are essential for tumor progression and metastasis.     Yet surprisingly little is known about the factors that drive the transcriptional reprogramming of stromal cells within tumors.     We report that the transcriptional regulator Heat-Shock Factor 1 (HSF1) is activated in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and is a potent enabler of malignancy.      In CAFs, HSF1 drives a transcriptional program that complements, yet is completely different from, the program it drives in adjacent cancer cells.     This CAF program is uniquely structured to support the malignant potential of cancer cells in a non-cell-autonomous way and involves two central stromal signaling molecules—TGFβ and stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF1). As clinical confirmation, in early stage breast and lung cancer high stromal HSF1 activation is strongly associated with poor patient outcome.     Thus, cancers co-opt the ancient, multifaceted survival functions of HSF1 to orchestrate malignant progression in unexpected ways that have far-reaching therapeutic implications.     Gene expression data We used microarrays to examine the HSF1-dependent effect of co-culture on gene expression in cancer cells and fibroblasts.     D2A1 mouse breast cancer cells were co-cultured with WT or Hsf1 null MEFs for 72h, afterwhich the two cell types were separated from each other by FACS and analyzed.     Each cell type was also grown separately, as control.
 E-GEOD-17004 - Inducible iPS Cells Support Full-term Development of Tetraploid Blastocyst–Complemented Embryos Differentiated somatic cells can be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells by forced expression of four transcription factors—Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. However, it remains undetermined whether the reprogrammed iPS cells are fully pluripotent, resembling normal embryonic stem (ES) cells, given that no iPS cell lines have been shown to possess the capability to autonomously generate full-term mice after injection into tetraploid blastocysts.     Here, we provide evidence demonstrating that iPS cells induced by the four transcription factors can be fully pluripotent and that full-term mice can be produced from complemented tetraploid blastocysts.     This work serves as a proof of principle that iPS cells can generate full term embryos by tetraploid complementation.     We compared the gene expression profile of iPS cell, ES cell and MEF. ES cell and MEF served as control for iPS cell.     Three biological repeats were included for each line.
 E-GEOD-32904 - EMT inducers catalyze malignant transformation of mammary epithelial cells and drive tumorigenesis towards claudin-low tumors [mouse] The newly identified claudin-low subtype of cancer is believed to represent the most primitive breast malignancies, having arisen from transformation of an early epithelial precursor with inherent stemness properties and metaplastic features.     Challenging this hypothesis, we show both in vitro and in vivo that transcription factors inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition can drive the development of claudin-low tumors from differentiated mammary epithelial cells, by playing a dual role in cell transformation and dedifferentiation.     Gene expression profiles of three independent Twist1 + Ras- transgenic mouse-derived metaplastic breast tumors (Breast Tumor A, B and C) and of two luminal MMTV-ERBB2/Neu-breast tumor-derived cell lines (1 and 2) were determined.
 E-GEOD-47719 - Derivation and maintenance of murine trophoblast stem cells under defined conditions Trophoblast stem (TS) cells are in vitro equivalents to the precursor cells of the placenta.     In mice, TS cells can be derived either from polar trophectoderm (TE) of blastocyst outgrowths or from postimplantation extraembryonic ectoderm (ExE), originating from polar TE. Since their first successful derivation in 1998 TS cells have been cultured in serum-rich medium in the presence of fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4), the cofactor heparin and embryonic fibroblast conditioned medium.     Here, we developed and tested a simple medium consisting of ten chemically defined ingredients for routine culture of TS cells.     The defined medium (TX medium) supports growth and self-renewal of TS cells grown on Matrigel-coated dishes over multiple ( 20) passages.     TS cells cultured under these conditions retain expression of key trophoblast stem cell-associated markers.     Global gene expression profiling of cells cultured in standard and TX media conditions revealed that 99.6 % of genes are similarly expressed.     DNA methylation profiling confirmed the faithful propagation of epigenomic characteristics of TS cells cultured in TX compared to standard media.     Importantly, TX media also supported the derivation of new TS cell lines directly from post implantation embryos.     In addition, TS cells cultured in TX retain their ability to differentiate into all derivatives of the trophectodermal lineage in vitro and give rise to haemorrhagic lesions in nude mice, indistinguishable from cells grown in standard conditions.     Further, injection into blastocysts proofs chimerization potential after TX culture.     The fact that TX media formulation no longer requires fetal bovine serum and conditioned medium facilitates and standardizes the culture of this extraembryonic lineage in vitro.     Cell culture.     TS cell lines TS-LacZ and TS-L5 have been derived from blastocysts and post implantation embryos us according to standard protocols.     Cells were grown on tissue culture plastic (TPP) at 37°C in humidified incubators containing 5% CO2 (Heraeus). For conventional stem cell culture cells were cultured in serum containing medium supplemented with 70% CM, 25 ng/ml human recombinant FGF4 (Reliatech) and 1 µg/ml Heparin (Sigma-Aldrich), hereafter named TS medium.     For differentiation experiments TS medium without CM,  FGF4 and heparin (TS -CMF4H) was used.     For stem cell culture in defined medium cells were cultured on Matrigel-coated dishes in TX medium.        TX medium formulation: DMEM/F12 (Life Technologies), 64 mg/l l-ascorbic acid-2-phosphate magnesium (Sigma), 14 microg/l sodium selenite (Sigma-Aldrich), 25 ng/ml human recombinant FGF4 (Reliatech), 19.4 mg/l insulin (Sigma-Aldrich), 543 mg/l NaHCO3 (Sigma-Aldrich), 10.7 mg/l holo-transferrin (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 ng/ml human recombinant TGF-beta1 (Peprotech), 1 microg/ml Heparin (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mM L-glutamine (PAN-biotech), 1% penicillin and streptomycin (PAN-biotech). Medium was prepared without growth factors, stored at 4°C and used within two weeks.     FGF4, heparin and TGFß were added to the medium prior to use.     Medium was changed every other day.     Cells were passaged when sub confluent, by incubation in trypsin-EDTA (PAN-biotech) for 4 min at 37°C. The enzyme was inactivated by addition of trypsin inhibitor (Life Technologies) in defined culture and by serum containing medium in case of conventional culture.     Cells were dissociated and plated in fresh medium.     Passage numbers are represented as x  + y, where x represents the passage number at which cells were transferred to TX medium, and y being the passage number in TX. For cryopreservation, cells were harvested and pellets were re-suspended either in FBS/10%DMSO (standard conditions) or in KnockOut Serum Replacement/10%DMSO (Life Technologies). Plate coating.     Tissue culture dishes for culture of TS cells in TX medium were coated with growth factor reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences), which was diluted 1:30 in ice cold DMEM/F12 and incubated over night at 4°C. Coating solution was aspirated immediately before plating cells.     For initial coating tests, plates were incubated either with Matrigel, poly-L-lysine, gelatine or fibronectin, respectively.     Poly-L-lysine was used at 0.01 % (w/v) in PBS (PAN-biotech) for 30 min at 37°C and washed once with PBS prior to use.     Gelatine coating was performed with 0.1% (w/v) gelatine solution in PBS for 30 min at 37°C. Dishes were incubated with fibronectin solution (16.7 µg/ml) for 30 min in the incubator, washed once with PBS and used thereafter.     Isolation of TS cells from post-implantation (E6.5) embryos Embryos were dissected in PBS on day E6.5 and transferred in PBS/10% (v/v) FBS and kept on ice.     Before dissociation, embryos were washed in PBS twice.     Whole conceptuses were transferred into an U-bottom 96-well plate and incubated in 40 µl trypsin-EDTA (PAN-biotech) for 15 min in the incubator.     The content of the well was pipetted up and down several times and transferred to a 24 well plate on pre-plated irradiated MEFS (gammaMEFs) in either TS medium with 1.5x FGF4 and heparin concentration (TS+1.5xF4H) or TX medium with 1.5x FGF4 and heparin (TX+1.5xF4H). TS cell colonies appeared after 2-4 days.     Immunofluorescent staining, western blotting.     Before staining, cells were washed with PBS once and fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich). Permeabilization of the cells was performed with 0.5 % (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 10 min and subsequent incubation for 30 min in blocking buffer (2% bovine serum albumin [Sigma-Aldrich], 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS). Samples were incubated overnight at 4°C with the following primary antibodies: Cdx2 (1:200, Cdx2-88,  BioGenex Inc), Eomes (1:500,ab23345, Abcam), Tfap2c (1:300, sc-8977, Santa Cruz). After three washing steps, detection was performed with appropriate Alexa Fluor-conjugated antibodies (Invitrogen) at a 1:500 dilution in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature in the dark.     After secondary antibody incubation, nuclei were stained with Hoechst (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells stained without primary antibodies served as controls.     Western blotting was performed with 23 µg of cell lysates from TS cells cultured in TS and TX media by SDS-polycrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto PVDF membranes.     Membranes were blocked with 5% (v/v) BSA or 5% (v/v) non-fat milk powder in TBST (TBS with 0.1% Tween). Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies at room temperature for 2 h, washed three times with TBST and labeled with HRP conjugated antibodies (Dako) for 1 h at room temperature.     After three washing steps with TBST, membranes were incubated in ECL substrate (Thermo Scientific). RNA isolation and analysis.     RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy Minikit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.     500 ng total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis by RevertAidPremium (Thermo Scientific). For gene expression microarray analysis, RNA quality was tested using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). 100 ng total RNA were used for cDNA synthesis.     Biotin labeling and fragmentation were performed according to the Affymetrix user manual.     cRNA was hybridized for 16h to Mouse Genome 430 2.0 GeneChip expression arrays (Affymetrix). After hybridization, arrays were washed and stained automatically on a GeneChip Fluidics station 450 (Affymetrix) and scanned with a GeneChip scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix). 6 samples were analyzed.

 E-GEOD-26430 - Effect of Glis1, Dmrtb1, and Pitx2 on mouse iPS cell generation Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) are generated from somatic cells by the transgene expression of three transcription factors Oct3/4, Sox2, and Klf4 (OSK), albeit at a low efficiency.     The protooncogene c-Myc enhances the efficiency of iPSC generation by OSK, but it also increases the tumorigenicity of the resulting iPSC. In the current study, we found the Gli-like transcription factor Glis1, when expressed together with OSK, to markedly enhance the generation of iPSC from both mouse and human fibroblasts.     Mouse iPSC generated by OSK and Glis1 can form germline-competent chimeras.     Glis1 is enriched in unfertilized oocytes and one cell-stage embryos.     DNA microarray analyses revealed that Glis1 promotes multiple pro-reprogramming pathways, including Myc, Nanog, Lin28, Wnt, mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), and Esrrb.     These results therefore demonstrated that oocyte transcription factor Glis1 effectively promote direct reprogramming during iPSC generation.     Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were transduced with OSKM, OSM+Glis1, OSM+Dmrtb1, and OSM+Pitx2 and were used for microarray analyses.
 E-GEOD-26814 - Isolation of epiblast stem cells from pre-implantation mouse embryos Pluripotent stem cells provide a platform to interrogate control elements that function to generate all cell types of the body.     Despite their utility for modeling development and disease, the relationship of mouse and human pluripotent stem cell states to one another remains largely undefined.      We have shown that mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) are distinct, pluripotent states isolated from pre- and post-implantation embryos respectively.      Human ES cells are different than mouse ES cells and share defining features with EpiSCs, yet are derived from pre-implantation human embryos.      Here we show that EpiSCs can be routinely derived from pre-implantation mouse embryos.      The pre-implantation-derived EpiSCs exhibit molecular features and functional properties consistent with bona fide EpiSCs.  These results provide a simple method for isolating EpiSCs and offer direct insight into the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that regulate the acquisition of distinct pluripotent states.     6 total samples were analyzed.      Three pluripotent cell types (mES cells, E3.5 EpiSCs, and E5.5 EpiSCs) were compared with and without treatment of SB431542 for 4 days.
 E-GEOD-35775 - The H3K27 demethylase Utx facilitates somatic and germ cell epigenetic reprogramming to pluripotency [Affymetrix gene expression] Pluripotency can be induced in somatic cells by ectopic expression of defined transcription factors, however the identity of epigenetic regulators driving the progression of cellular reprogramming requires further investigation.     Here we uncover a non-redundant role for the JmjC-domain-containing protein histone H3 methylated Lys 27 (H3K27) demethylase Utx, as a critical regulator for the induction, but not for the maintenance, of primed and naïve pluripotency in mice and in humans.     Utx depletion results in aberrant H3K27me3 repressive chromatin demethylation dynamics, which subsequently hampers the reactivation of pluripotency promoting genes during reprogramming.     Remarkably, Utx deficient primordial germ cells (PGCs) display a cell autonomous aberrant epigenetic reprogramming in vivo during their embryonic maturation, resulting in the lack of functional contribution to the germ-line lineage.     Samples include UTX+/Y (WT) and UTX-/Y (KO) cells from mouse ES cells and mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) before and after DOX induction (initiating reprogramming by OSKM factors). One sample is OSKM-induced Nanog-/- fibroblasts.
 E-GEOD-26520 - Principal components of embryonic stem cell pluripotency To decipher gene regulatory networks, we used systematic suppression of 97 transcription factors (TFs) and 7 other genes with shRNA in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, followed by global gene expression profiling.     Meta-analysis of these data together with the earlier data obtained by the induction of 50 TFs and the existing genome-wide data on TF binding sites identified the sets of regulated target genes for 23 TFs. Principal component analysis shows different roles of two groups of TFs that are active in ES cells: Pou5f1 and Sox2 support the expression of their target genes and prevent the upregulation of trophectoderm-related genes, whereas Esrrb, Sall4, Nanog, Gbx2, Grhl2, Mtf2, Aff1, Tcfap4, and Cdc5l support the expression of targets of Esrrb, including glycolysis genes, and prevent upregulation of targets of Trp53 and Polycomb TFs. If TFs from the second group are downregulated while Pou5f1 and Sox2 are still active, then the cell state changes towards epiblast lineages.     Sequences for shRNA were designed to target 3    untranslated region of genes (Supplementary Table S8). Gene expression change was checked with real time qPCR (Supplementary Figure S7) and Westerm blot.     ES cells (ES[MC1R(20)], passage 20) were cultured without feeders and were co-transfected with 1.6  g of shRNA expression vector and 0.4  g of pPyCAG-EGFP-IP carrying expression cassettes for puromycin resistant genes and EGFP using Effectene (Qiagen). Transfected cells were cultured in presence of 1.5  g/ml of puromycin and were harvested at 72 h after transfection.     Mock cells were treated with transfection reagent without DNA and cultured in the absence of puromycin.     Experiments were done in 3 replications with 2 of them used for gene expression profiling with microarrays.      Total RNA was isolated by TRIzol (Invitrogen) after 2 days.     Cy3-CTP labeled sample targets were prepared with total RNA by Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear  Amplification Kit (Agilent). Cy5-CTP labeled reference target was Stratagene Universal Mouse Reference RNA.  Note that the processed data in the paper, which is also attached as GSE26520 Table data.txt.gz, is slightly different from the values columns in each sample.     The original processed data are normalized with a batch method, as the new batches of arrays added in the set.      The value columns in this submission reflect full normalization as described in the data processing fields in each sample.

 E-GEOD-20519 - Gene expression analysis of leukemic samples in C57BL6 mice [original title] Gene expression analysis of leukemic samples derived from AF4-MLL- or AF4-MLL/MLL-AF4-transduced and transplanted hematopoietic stem/precursor cells in C57BL6 mice.      We used microarrays to analyze the global gene expression in leukemic cells with three distinct immunophenotypes.     We compared leukemic cells isolated from the bone marrow of diseased mice and compared these profiles with normal bone marrow.
 E-GEOD-36814 - Role for DNA methylation in response to Gata4 activation in embryonic stem cell-derived mesoderm During embryogenesis, many key transcription factors are used repeatedly, achieving different outcomes depending on cell type and developmental stage.     The epigenetic modification of the genome functions as a memory of a cell’s developmental history, and it has been proposed that such modification shapes the cellular response to transcription factors.     To investigate the role of DNA methylation in the response to transcription factor Gata4, we examined expression profiles of Dnmt3a-/-Dnmt3b-/- ES cell-derived mesoderm cells cultured for 4 days with or without Gata4 activation, as well as the wild-type counterparts, using Affymetrix microarrays.     Wild-type and Dnmt3a-/-Dnmt3b-/- (DKO) ES cell clones stably expressing dexamethasone (Dex)-inducible Gata4 were generated by introducing an expression plasmid for Gata4 fused with the ligand-binding domain of the human glucocorticoid receptor (Gata4GR) driven by the CAG promoter, by electroporation.     For mesoderm differentiation, 1 x 10^5 ES cells were plated on a type IV collagen-coated 10-cm dish and cultured for 4 days.     Cultured cells were harvested and collected as single-cell suspensions using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, followed by incubation in differentiation medium at 37˚C to allow cell-surface markers to recover.     Flk1(+)/PDGFRalpha(+) double-positive (DP) cells, which are considered equivalent to the lateral plate mesoderm, were sorted by FACS-Aria (BD Biosciences). Sorted DP cells were further cultured on type IV collagen-coated culture dishes in the absence or presence of 100 nM Dex for 4 days.     For reference data, primitive endoderm (PE) cells were directly differentiated from undifferentiated ES cells by addition 100 nM Dex in ES cell-maintenance medium.

 E-GEOD-32598 - Highly efficient derivation of ventricular cardiomyocytes from induced pluripotent stem cells with a distinct epigenetic signature The generation of sufficient numbers of mature ventricular myocytes for effective cell-based therapy is a central barrier for cardiac regenerative medicine.     Here we demonstrate that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be derived from murine ventricular myocytes, and consistent with other reports of iPSCs derived from various somatic cell types, ventricular myocyte derived iPSCs (ViPSCs) exhibit a markedly higher propensity to differentiate into beating cardiomyocytes as compared to genetically-matched embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or iPSCs derived from tail-tip fibroblasts.     Strikingly, ViPSC-derived cardiomyocytes form up to 99% ventricular myocytes suggesting that ventricular myocyte-derived iPSCs may be a viable strategy to generate specific cardiomyocyte subtypes for cell-based therapies.     The enhanced ventricular myogenesis in ViPSCs is mediated via increased numbers of cardiovascular progenitors at early stages of differentiation.     In order to investigate the mechanism of enhanced ventricular myogenesis from ViPSCs, we performed global gene expression and DNA methylation analysis, which revealed a distinct epigenetic signature that may be involved in specifying the ventricular myocyte fate in pluripotent stem cells.     Total RNA was extracted from mouse ES cells,  tail tip fibroblasts (TTFs), ventricular myocytes (VMs), TTF-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (TiPSCs) and VM-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (ViPSCs).  Global gene expression profiling was performed using affymetrix mouse 430 2.0 gene arrays.
 E-GEOD-29441 - Uniform, integration-free iPS cells with a safeguard system using human artificial chromosome vectors Human artificial chromosomes (HACs) have unique characteristics as gene-delivery vector, e.g., episomal transmission and transfer of multiple, large transgenes.     Here, we demonstrate the advantages of HAC vectors for reprogramming mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells.     Two HAC vectors (iHAC1 and iHAC2) were constructed.     Both carried four reprogramming factors, and iHAC2 also encoded a p53-knockdown construct (see Kazuki et al 2011). The iHAC1 partially reprogrammed MEFs, and the iHAC2 efficiently reprogrammed MEFs. Global gene expression showed that the iHACs, unlike other vectors, generated relatively uniform iPS cells.     We established iHAC-free iPS cells by isolating cells that spontaneously lost the iHAC2. Analyses of pluripotent markers, teratomas, and chimeras confirmed that these iHAC-free iPS cells were pluripotent.     Moreover, iHAC-free iPS cells with a re-introduced HAC encoding Herpes Simplex Virus Thymidine Kinase were eliminated by Ganciclovir treatment; therefore, the HAC safeguard system functioned in iPS cells.     Thus, the HAC vector could generate uniform, integration-free iPS cells with a safeguard system.     Total RNA from mouse embryonic fibroblasts, two control ES cells (TT2 and B6ES), retrovirus vector-derived iPS cells (20D17), and twelve HAC-derived iPS clones were hybridized to the Agilent Whole Mouse Genome microarrays.
 E-GEOD-22432 - TGF-β1 Accelerates Dendritic Cell Differentiation from Common Dendritic Cell Progenitors (CDPs) and Directs Subset Specification Towards Conventional Dendritic Cells Dendritic cells (DCs) in lymphoid tissue comprise conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) that develop from common DC progenitors (CDPs). CDPs are Flt3+c-kitintM-CSFR+ and reside in bone marrow.     Here we describe a two-step culture system that recapitulates DC development from c-kithiFlt3-/lo multipotent progenitors (MPPs) into CDPs and further into cDC and pDC subsets.     MPPs and CDPs are amplified in vitro with Flt3 ligand, stem cell factor, hyper-IL-6 and insulin- like growth factor-1. The four-factor cocktail readily induces self-renewal of MPPs and their progression into CDPs and has no self-renewal activity on CDPs. The amplified CDPs respond to all known DC poietins and generate all lymphoid tissue DCs in vivo and in vitro.     Additionally, in vitro CDPs recapitulate the cell surface marker and gene expression profile of in vivo CDPs and possess a DC-primed transcription profile.     Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) impacts on CDPs and directs their differentiation towards cDCs. Genome-wide gene expression profiling of TGF-β1-induced genes identified transcription factors, such as interferon regulatory factor-4 (IRF-4) and RelB, that are implicated as instructive factors for cDC subset specification.     TGF-β1 also induced the transcription factor inhibitor of differentiation/DNA binding 2 (Id2) that suppresses pDC development.     Thus, TGF-β1 directs CDP differentiation into cDC by inducing both cDC instructive factors and pDC inhibitory factors.     20 samples in total.      Multipotent progenitor - MPP 1 - MPP 2 Common dendritic cell progenitor - CDP 1 - CDP 2 Plasmacytoid dendritic cell - pDC 1 - pDC 2 Conventional dendritic cell - cDC 1 - cDC 2 In vivo common dendritic cell progenitor  - In vivo CDP 1 - In vivo CDP 2  Untreated common dendritic cell progenitor (CDP)  - CDP 0h 1 - CDP 0h 2 TGF-beta1 treated (4 hours) CDP - CDP 4h 1 - CDP 4h 2 TGF-beta1 treated (8 hours) CDP - CDP 8h 1 - CDP 8h 2 TGF-beta1 treated (12 hours) CDP - CDP 12h 1 - CDP 12h 2 TGF-beta1 treated (24 hours) CDP - CDP 24h 1 - CDP 24h 2
 E-GEOD-25872 - Conversion of murine extraembryonic trophoblast stem cells into induced pluripotent stem cells Extraembryonic trophoblast stem cells (TSC) can be converted to induced pluripotent stem cells (TSC-iPSCs) by overexpressing Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and cMyc. TSC lines were derived from mice harboring a doxycycline inducible Oct4 allele and an Oct4-GFP reporter that has been demonstrated to be activated in cells upon acquisition of pluripotency.     Oct4-GFP-positive blastocysts were collected at 3.5 dpc and transduced with lentiviruses encoding doxycycline inducible Sox2, Klf4 and cMyc transgenes (4FTSC). 4FTSC lines were passaged 10 times to establish a population of constantly growing, self-renewing TSCs in the presence of FGF4 and fibroblast conditioned media.     To induce lineage conversion, 4FTSCs were cultured under ESC/Lif conditions and doxycycline.     After 28 days, several colonies displaying ESC-characteristic dome-shaped colony morphology and bright Oct4-GFP fluorescence could be detected.     The 4FTSC-derived colonies were isolated mechanically, dissociated by trypsinization, and plated onto MEFs in ESC medium without doxycycline demonstrating the independence of exogenous factors.     They will be called TSC-iPSCs (Trophoblast stem cell derived induced pluripotent stem cells). To examine if the extraembryonic lineage-specific mRNA profile was overcome, the gene-expression profiles of TSC-iPSCs and their parental 4FTSCs were analyzed by microarray analyses and compared to control ESCs.
 E-GEOD-50146 - Proteasome inhibition and oxidative biochemistry are synergistic triggers of metabolic heme toxicity (part 2) Control of intracellular heme levels by extracellular scavenger proteins and intracellular heme oxygenases are essential functions during disease states with enhanced extracellular heme release.     During severe hemolysis or rhabdomyolysis uncontrolled heme exposure can cause acute kidney injury and endothelial damage.     The cytotoxic activity of heme has been primarily attributed to its pro-oxidative potential.     However, the mechanisms of heme toxicity have never been systematically explored.     Besides its redox reactivity, heme could also adversely alter cellular functions through its broad binding affinity to multiple non-hemoproteins.     Such interactions may impair protein functions and support heme toxicity.     In this study we mapped the gene expression profile of Hb triggered acute kidney injury in old blood transfused guinea pigs by serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE). Additionally, the toxic heme response of mouse embryo fibroblasts was systematically characterized on the gene and protein expression levels by gene array experiments and quantitative mass-spectrometry of stable isotope labeled cells.     In all these studies, in addition to oxidative stress signals, the most significant signals were reproducibly found for biologic networks related to altered protein degradation, which ultimately triggers the response to unfolded proteins and apoptosis.     These screening data could be mechanistically explained by heme-proteasome interactions and a proteasome inhibitor activity of heme.     Proteasome inhibition drastically reduced the threshold of cellular toxicity during heme exposure.     We therefore propose a novel model of heme toxicity whereby proteasome inhibition by the porphyrin fuels a vicious cycle of oxidative protein modification, accumulation of damaged proteins, cell damage and apoptosis.     A two color common reference design was chosen with 2-8 independent biological replicates of each condition.     Each experimental sample (Cy5 labeled) was hybridized against a non-treated reference sample (Cy3 labeled). To compensate for dye bias control arrays with competitively hybridized Cy3- and Cy5-labeled non-treated reference samples were used.     The latter allowed for a very robust statistical analysis with pair-wise comparison of treatment array replicates versus the corresponding control array replicates.

 E-GEOD-44972 - Cell reprogramming requires silencing of a core subset of Polycomb targets. Transcription factor (TF)-induced reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) is associated with genome-wide changes in chromatin modifications.     Polycomb-mediated histone H3 lysine-27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) has been proposed as a defining mark that distinguishes the somatic from the iPSC epigenome.     Here, we dissected the functional role of H3K27me3 in TF-induced reprogramming through the inactivation of the H3K27 methylase EZH2 at the onset of reprogramming.     Our results demonstrate that surprisingly the establishment of functional iPSC proceeds despite global loss of H3K27me3. iPSC lacking EZH2 efficiently silenced the somatic transcriptome and differentiated into tissues derived from the three germ layers.     Remarkably, the genome-wide analysis of H3K27me3 in Ezh2 mutant iPSC cells revealed the retention of this mark on a highly selected group of Polycomb targets enriched for developmental regulators controlling the expression of lineage specific genes.     Erasure of H3K27me3 from these targets led to a striking impairment in TF-induced reprogramming.     These results indicate that PRC2-mediated H3K27 trimethylation is required on a highly selective core of Polycomb targets whose repression enables TF-dependent cell reprogramming.     Genechip microarray analysis was performed respectively on 4 Ezh2 +/+ iPSC clones (control), 4 Ezh2 ∆SET/∆SET iPSC clones (experimental), 3 independent preparations of wild type MEF (reference) and one sample of E14Tg2a embryonic stem cells (reference) using Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST arrays.     Labeling, hybridization, and washing were performed according to Affymetrix guidelines
 E-GEOD-15587 - Identification of Metastasis-prone Lung Adenocarcinoma Cell Population That Is Sensitive to Notch Inhibition Tumor cells that give rise to metastatic disease are a primary cause of cancer-related death and have not been fully elucidated in patients with lung cancer.     Here, we addressed this question by using tissues from a mouse that develops metastatic lung adenocarcinoma owing to expression of mutant K-ras and p53. We identified a metastasis-prone population of tumor cells that differed from those with low metastatic capacity on the basis of having sphere-forming capacity in Matrigel cultures, increased expression of CD133 and Notch ligands, and relatively low tumorigenicity in syngeneic mice.     Knockdown of jagged1 or pharmacologic inhibition of its downstream mediator phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase abrogated the metastatic but not the tumorigenic activity of these cells.     We conclude from these studies on a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma that CD133 and Notch ligands mark a population of metastasis-prone tumor cells and that the efficacy of Notch inhibitors in metastasis prevention should be explored.      Keywords: two group comparison 344SQ subcutaneous tumors (from a lung adenocarcinoma cell line derived from a KrasLA1/+; p53R172HdelG/+ mouse that metastasizes widely following subcutaneous injection into syngeneic mice) were sorted by flow cytometry into CD133high and CD133low fractions.      RNA samples from these fractions were processed and analyzed on Affymetrix Mouse Expression Array 430A 2.0 chips.
 E-GEOD-37859 - Gene expression profile of mouse induced neural stem cells The iNSC cells are two clones generated from the same MEF line.      Therefore, we conducted one analysis that compared the two clonal lines and a separate analysis that compared iNSC vs. NSC, iNSC vs. MEF, and NSC vs. MEF.  Both were single factor ANOVAs, the first compared two groups (the iNSC lines) and the second had three groups.      For the second analysis, we then used linear contrasts to extract the information about differences between all pairs (e.g. iNSC vs. NSC). Looking at the iNSC lines, the correlations between samples from different clonal lines are as high as the correlations between samples from within a clonal line.      Given this, we think that the analysis that combines all 6 of them to compare against the other cell types is appropriate.

 E-GEOD-61433 - Lineage reprogramming of adult mouse liver cells and B-lymphocytes to neural stem-like cells using defined factors [expression array] The overexpression of transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc reprograms a somatic nucleus to one that is transcriptionally and epigenetically indistinguishable from an embryonic stem (ES) cell.     However, it is still unclear if transcription factors can completely convert the nucleus of a differentiated cell into that of a distantly related cell type such that it maintains complete transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming in the absence of exogenous factor expression.     To test this idea, we screened a library of doxycycline-inducible vectors encoding neural stem cell (NSC)-expressed genes and found that stable, self-maintaining NSC-like cells could be induced under defined growth conditions after transduction of transcription factors.     These induced NSCs (iNSCs) were characterized in the absence of exogenous factor induction and were shown to be transcriptionally, epigenetically, and functionally similar to endogenous embryonic cortical NSCs. Importantly, iNSCs could be generated from multiple adult cell types including liver cells and B-cells with genetic rearrangements.      Our results show that self-maintaining proliferative neural cells can be induced from non-ectodermal cells by expressing specific combinations of transcription factors.     Expression analysis was performed on mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), primary-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) and induced neural stem cells (iNSCs).
 E-GEOD-21595 - Comparisons between fully and partially reprogrammed iPS cells induced by pMX-Klf4, pMX-Oct4 and pMX-Sox2 retroviruses Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell reprogramming is a gradual epigenetic process that reactivates the pluripotent transcriptional network by erasing and establishing heterochromatin marks.      Here, we characterize the physical structure of heterochromatin domains in full and partial mouse iPS cells by correlative Electron Spectroscopic Imaging (ESI). In somatic and partial iPS cells, constitutive heterochromatin marked by H3K9me3 is highly compartmentalized into chromocenter structures of densely packed 10 nm chromatin fibers.      In contrast, chromocenter boundaries are poorly defined in pluripotent ES and full iPS cells, and are characterized by unusually dispersed 10 nm heterochromatin fibers in high Nanog-expressing cells, including pluripotent cells of the mouse blastocyst prior to differentiation.     This heterochromatin reorganization accompanies retroviral silencing during conversion of partial iPS cells by Mek/Gsk3 2i inhibitor treatment.      Thus, constitutive heterochromatin reorganization serves as a novel biomarker with retroviral silencing for identifying iPS cells in the very late stages of reprogramming.     We compared the expression profiles of partially and fully reprogrammed iPS cell lines derived from CD1 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFSs) by retroviral reprogramming (pMX-Oct4, pMX-Klf4 and pMX-Sox2). to the differentiated MEFS and the J1 embryonic stem cell line.     We also studied the effect of a 2i cocktail treatment in partially reprogrammed iPS cells.

 E-GEOD-70495 - Expression data from RDI treated T-ALL cells RUNX1 and CBFB, which encode subunits of the core binding factor, are frequent targets of chromosomal aberrations in hematological malignancies.     We previously determined that CBFβ  (encoded by CBFB) is important for the transforming activity of the chimeric protein AML1-ETO (RUNX1-RUNX1T1) generated by the t(8;21), and other studies showed that normal Runx1 functions are essential for survival and maintenance of some leukemias lacking RUNX1 or CBFB mutations.     Thus, we hypothesized that we could achieve therapeutic efficacy in multiple leukemias by targeting the Runx1:CBFβ interaction with small molecule inhibitors.     Using the structure of the DNA binding Runt domain (RD) of Runx1 and its interface with CBFβ, we employed a computational screen of a library of 78,000 drug-like compounds, and further optimized our initial hits.     The Runt domain inhibitors (RDIs) bind directly to the RD and disrupt its interaction with CBFβ. These tool compounds reduced growth and induced apoptosis of t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, and reduced the progenitor activity of mouse and human leukemia cells harboring the t(8;21), but not normal bone marrow cells.     The RDIs had similar effects on murine and human T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines that did not harbor the t(8;21) A murine T-ALL cell line 720, derived from Tcf12+/- mouse expressing a Tal1 transgene under the control of the Lck promoter, was especially sensitive to the inhibitors.     To gain a better understanding of the mechanism of action of the Runt Domain Inhibitors (RDIs) we performed global gene expression analysis of the highly responsive 720 T-ALL cells following treatment.     720 T-ALL cells were treated with RDIs and harvested 8 hours later, before they underwent apoptosis, and expression was analyzed using microarrays.     720 T-ALL cells were cultured in the presence of Runt Domain Inhibitors for 8 hours, total RNA was then purified and gene expression was analyzed by microarray.

 E-GEOD-62957 - Early reprogramming stages and regulators identified by prospective isolation and single cell mass cytometry In the context of most induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell reprogramming methods,  heterogeneous populations of nonproductive and staggered productive intermediates arise at different reprogramming time points1-11. Despite recent reports claiming substantially increased reprogramming efficiencies using genetically modified donor cells12,13 prospectively isolating distinct reprogramming intermediates remains an important goal to decipher reprogramming mechanisms.     Previous attempts to identify surface markers of intermediate cell populations were based on the assumption that during reprogramming the cells progressively lose donor cell identity and gradually acquire iPS cell properties1,2,7,8,10. Here, we report that iPS cell and epithelial markers, such as SSEA1 and EpCAM, respectively, are not predictive of reprogramming during early phases.     Instead, in a systematic functional surface marker screen we find that early reprogramming-prone cells express a unique set of surface markers, including CD73, CD49d and CD200 that are absent in fibroblasts and iPS cells.      Single cell mass cytometry and prospective isolation show that these distinct intermediates are transient and bridge the gap between donor cell silencing and pluripotency marker acquisition during the early, presumably stochastic reprogramming phase2. Expression profiling revealed that the transcriptional regulators Nr0b1 and Etv5 are specifically expressed in this early reprogramming state, preceding activation of key pluripotency regulators such as Rex1, Dppa2, Nanog and Sox2. Both factors are required for the generation of the early intermediate state and fully reprogrammed iPS cells, and thus mark some of the earliest known regulators of iPS cell induction.      Our study shows an ordered sequence of transitions during the earliest steps of iPS cell reprogramming that deconvolutes the first steps in a hierarchical series of events that lead to pluripotency acquisition.     Samples for poised (CD73+ or CD49d+) and non-poised (CD73-) reprogramming samples were FACS sorted 6 and 9 days after induction of Klf4, Oct4, Sox2 and cMyc in Rosa-rtTA +/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).  'Total' populations are expression analyses for unsorted populations analyzed at the same time points.      Control populations were also sampled: mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), partially reprogrammed cells (SC4) and mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC).
 E-GEOD-39637 - Gene expression in pluripotent and TSKM-iPS induction cells. We found that Tet1 (T) can substitute Oct4 and initiates somatic cell reprogramming in combination with Sox2 (S), Klf4 (K) and c-Myc (M). Moreover, the TSKM secondary reprogramming can proceed rapidly with widespread accompanying increase of 5hmC and 5mC at TSS and ES-active regulation regions followed by 5mC-5hmC pattern switchand, and the activation of endogenous Oct4 and Nanog was Tet1 and 5hmC involved in this process.     We used microarray to explore the global expression change during the reprogramming process Examination of gene expression change in 3 different cell lines covering the main stages during the reprogramming process
 E-GEOD-46158 - Microarray analysis of IdHP cells compared to LKS, Control ProB and E2A-/- progenitors Self-renewal potential and multipotency are hallmarks of the stem cell1-3. It is generally conceived that acquisition of such a stemness requires rejuvenation of somatic cells through reprogramming of genetic and epigenetic status.     We show here that a simple blockage of cell differentiation is sufficient to make stem cells.     By over-expression of transcriptional repressor Id3 in murine hematopoitic progenitor cells and cultivation of these cells in B cell induction conditions, cells exhibit developmental arrest and enter a self-renewal cycle.     These cells can be maintained in vitro almost limitlessly, and the long-term cultured cells exhibited robust multi-lineage reconstitution when transferred into irradiated mice.     These cells can be cloned and re-expanded with 50% of plating efficiency, indicating that virtually all cells are self-renewing.     Equivalent progenitors were produced from progenitors in human cord blood.     Thus produced stem cells will be useful as the source of cells for immune cell therapy.     Four samples
 E-GEOD-67462 - Expression data from OSKM-mediated 2nd reprogramming cells and the corresponding iPS cell line Forced expression of four transcription factors Oct4,Sox2, Klf4 and Myc (OSKM) induces somatic cell reprogramming towards pluripotency.     Major efforts have been made to characterize the molecular events involved in this process.     Yet, it remains elusive how gene expression change, epigenetic landscape remodelling and cell fate conversion are triggered by expression of these Yamanaka factors.To address this gap,we utilized a secondary inducible reprogramming system and performed genome-wide profilings of Oct4 binding, histone modification(H3K4me3/H3K27me3/H3K4me1/H3K27ac), and gene expression analysis during this process.     Through integrative analysis, we revealed stage-specific Oct4 binding and enhancer signatures in consistence with gene expression changes,in which the initial regression of somatic program is followed by the gradual acquisition of pluripotent program.     Oct4 preferatially binds to H3K4me1 marked enhancer regions and Oct4 binding is positively correlated with active mark H3K27ac. Moreover,we observed significant enhancer activation of epigenetic related genes, especially acetylation associated genes, prior to pluripotency network activation, suggesting a pivotal role of epigenetic remodelling in the process of pluripotency acquisition and maintenance.     We used microarrays to explore the global changes of gene expression during OSKM-mediated somatic cell reprogramming.     time series design with bulk population samples collected at different time point of 2nd reprogramming as well as a corresponding iPS cell line.     Each sample include two replicates.     2nd mouse embryonic fibroblasts(sample day0) were treated with ES medium supplemented with 1µg/ml Doxcycline and 50µg/ml Vitamin C for 15 days (sample day1-day15); 72 hours after dox and Vc withdrawl, dox-independent iPS cells are collected(sample day18).

 E-GEOD-10246 - Transcription profiling by array of Mus musculus tissues - GNF Mouse GeneAtlas V3 Monocytes and macrophages express an extensive repertoire of G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) that regulate inflammation and immunity.     In this study we performed a systematic microarray analysis of GPCR expression in primary mouse tissues to identify family members that are either enriched in macrophages compared to a panel of other cell types, or are regulated by an inflammatory stimulus, the bacterial product lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Experiment Overall Design: Multiple tissues were taken from naïve male C57BL6 mice for hybridization to MOE430 2 arrays

 E-GEOD-22938 - Identification and analysis of expression of novel microRNAs of murine gammaherpesvirus 68 Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV-68) is closely related to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and provides a small animal model to study the pathogenesis of gammaherpesvirus (γHV) infections.     To completely explore the potential of the MHV-68 system for the investigation of gHV miRNAs, it would be desirable to know the number and expression patterns of all miRNAs encoded by MHV-68. By using small RNA deep sequencing, we systematically investigated the MHV-68 miRNA expression profiles in both lytically and persistently infected cells.     In addition to the known nine MHV-68 miRNAs, we identified six novel MHV-68 miRNA genes and analyzed the expression levels of all MHV-68 miRNAs. Furthermore, we also characterized the cellular miRNA expression signatures in MHV-68 infected versus non-infected NIH3T3 fibroblasts and in TPA-treated versus non-treated S11 cells.     We found that mmu-mir-15b and mmu-mir-16 are highly upregulated upon MHV-68 infection of NIH3T3 cells, indicating a potential role of cellular miRNAs during MHV-68 infection.     Our data will aid to fully explore the functions of gHV miRNAs. A mouse fibroblast cell line infected with/without MHV-68 and a MHV-68 infected mouse B lymphoma cell line treated with/without TPA (4 samples in total) were examined.

 E-GEOD-56876 - Arid3a modulates the first cell fate decision by direct regulation of both embryonic and extraembryonic gene expression (ChIP-Seq) Arid3a, a transcription factor known for its requirement in B-lymphocyte development, has been recently identified as a member of ES cell pluripotency network.     Arid3a is moderately expressed in ES cells, and its expression is gradually increased during differentiation.     Since Arid3a shows the highest expression in placenta, we hypothesized that Arid3a may play important roles in TE development.     We report that Arid3a is a central regulator of both TE-specific and pluripotency-associated gene expression during ES cell differentiation.     While dispensable for self-renewal, we observed that knockdown of Arid3a delays differentiation of ES cells.     Induction of Arid3a leads ES cells to promote differentiation, specifically towards TE lineage.     Moreover, these Arid3a-overexpressing cells maintained in TE culture media are sufficient to generate functional trophoblast stem-like cells, suggesting roles of Arid3a in TE differentiation.     By integrative analyses using the chromosomal targets of Arid3a with expression profiling, we revealed the dual roles of Arid3a, as a direct activator of TE-specific genes and a repressor of pluripotency-associated genes.     We further revealed the repressive roles of Arid3a are mediated by histone deacetylases (HDACs). Taken together, our results demonstrate that Arid3a is a critical novel regulator in TE lineage specification.     Arid3a ChIP was performed using bioChIP-sequencing.     Control ChIP-sequencing was performed using BirA cells.     HDAC1 ChIP was performed as native antibody ChIP-sequencing.
 E-GEOD-44393 - Chip-seq for H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 in DNA methylation deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts DNA methylation and the Polycomb Repression System are epigenetic mechanisms that play important roles in maintaining transcriptional repression.     Recent evidence suggests that DNA methylation can attenuate the binding of Polycomb protein components to chromatin and thus plays a role in determining their genomic targeting.     However, whether this role of DNA methylation is important in the context of transcriptional regulation is unclear.     By genome-wide mapping of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-signature histone mark, H3K27me3, in severely DNA hypomethylated mouse somatic cells, we show that hypomethylation leads to widespread H3K27me3 redistribution, in a manner that reflects the local DNA methylation status in wild-type cells.     Unexpectedly, we observe striking loss of H3K27me3 and PRC2 from Polycomb-target gene promoters in DNA hypomethylated cells, including Hox gene clusters.     Importantly, we show that many of these genes become ectopically expressed in DNA hypomethylated cells, consistent with loss of Polycomb-mediated repression.     An intact DNA methylome is required for appropriate Polycomb-mediated gene repression by constraining PRC2 targeting.     These observations identify a previously unappreciated role for DNA methylation in gene regulation and therefore influence our understanding of how this epigenetic mechanism contributes to normal development and disease.     comparison of Dnmt1+/+ vs Dnmt1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts by ChIP-seq for H3K27me3 and H3K4me3
 E-GEOD-57250 - Transcriptional regulation of Tet1 during development 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is a recently discovered epigenetic modification that is lost in human cancers.     Formation of 5hmC is catalysed by the Ten eleven translocation (TET) proteins that mediate the sequential oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5hmC, leading to eventual DNA demethylation.     Several mechanisms can lead to loss of 5hmC in cancers, including mutations in IDH or TET2 genes.     However, little is known about the role of TET proteins and 5hmC in adult cells.     Here, we report that TET1 downmodulation is required to permit adult cells to proliferate.     TET1 is rapidly downmodulated in proliferating primary cells and in regenerating liver.     TET1 silencing accelerates cell cycle progression while its constitutive expression inhibits cell growth.     TET1 is a negative regulator of cell proliferation and it is regulated during development in tissue specific manner.     These findings enlarge our knowledge on how one epigenetic modification such as the DNA hydroxymethylation mediated by TET1 is a key player on the control of cell proliferation.     Examination of 5hmC in MEF at passage 0 and at passage 5.
 E-GEOD-75370 - Distinct activities of Myf5 and MyoD indicate sequential roles in skeletal muscle lineage specification and differentiation (ChIP-Seq) In this work we compare the molecular functions of Myf5 and MyoD, two highly related bHLH transcription factors that regulate skeletal muscle specification and differentiation.     We find MyoD and Myf5 bind the same sites genome-wide but have distinct functions: Myf5 induces histone acetylation without Pol II recruitment or robust gene activation, whereas MyoD induces histone acetylation, recruits PolII and robustly activates gene transcription.     Chip-seq profiling of MyoD, Myf5, Histone H4 acetylation (H4Ac), and Pol II in MyoD-/-; Myf5-/- MEFs (M&M MEFs)

 E-GEOD-47890 - Maintenance of DNA methylation in embryonic stem cells depends on the histone H3K9 methyltransferases (K9 KO Methyl-Seq) During mammalian development DNA methylation patterns need to be reset in primordial germ cells (PGC) and preimplantation embryos.     However, many retro-transposons and imprinted genes are resistant to such global epigenetic reprogramming via hitherto undefined mechanisms.     Here, we report that some of these sequences are immune to widespread erasure of DNA methylation in the mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) lacking de novo DNA methyltransferases.     Persistence of DNA methylation at these loci in mESCs depends on the histone H3K9 methyltransferase Setdb1, as deletion of Setdb1 results in reduction of H3K9me3 and DNA methylation levels concomitant with an increase in 5-hydroxymethylation (5hmC). In addition, depletion of H3K9 methyltransferase G9a leads to genome-wide reduction of DNA methylation but to a lesser extent at the above sequences.     Taken together, these data reveal that Setdb1 ensures the fidelity of DNA methylation at specific loci in mESCs, which may reflect mechanisms functioning in vivo during key developmental stages.     Examination of genome-wide DNA methylation status in 3 cell types.
 E-GEOD-73112 - Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase regulates peripheral B cell receptor revision, polyreactivity and B1 cells in lupus FAAH expresson is induced in Sle2 splenic B cells.     Increased peripheral B cell receptor revision, or selective peripheral expansion of BCR-revised B-cells, may lead to systemic autoimmunity, and FAAH is a lupus susceptibility gene that could regulate this process in Sle2 mice.     To determine the gene expression profile in peripheral B cells from Sle2 mice (compared to B6 mice), we isolated splenic B cells from these two strains of mice, extracted the total mRNA and performed the microarray analysis Please note that Sle2 mouse is a congenic strain that harbors the Sle2 locus from Chromosome 4 of NZM2410 strain in a B6 background and Sle2 is the name of the lupus susceptibility locus.
 E-GEOD-64358 - Quantitative analysis of chromatin interactions upon copy number variation at mouse 4E2 [4C-seq] The three-dimensional organization of chromatin has a critical impact on the regulation of gene expression.     However, little is known about the effect of DNA copy number variants (CNVs) on chromatin organization.     We performed an allele-specific chromatin conformation and gene expression analysis of wild-type (WT) mouse chromosome 4 and an engineered 4.3Mb chromosome 4 deletion in mouse embryonic fibroblasts.     A newly developed quantitative framework for the analysis of paired-end 4C-seq data revealed a number of significant differentially interacting regions (DIRs) and higher-order chromatin compaction changes present in the deletion chromosome.     Selected DIRs were validated by 3D DNA FISH experiments.     We discovered a significant enrichment of CTCF and Smc1 binding sites within DIRs, as well as differentially expressed genes determined by RNA-Seq. Together, our findings highlight the complex effects of a 4E2 CNV on chromatin structure and function, both locally in the deletion chromosome and globally in the WT copy.     Examination of chromatin contacts and gene expression in wild type chromosome 4 and a 4.3Mb deletion in chromosome 4 in mouse
 E-GEOD-63756 - Transcription profiling by high throughput sequencing of mouse embryonic fibroblasts treated with tunicamycin to study the transcriptional response to endoplasmic reticulum stress Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress occurs when misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER. The cellular response to ER stress involves complex transcriptional and translational changes, important to the survival of the cell.     ER stress is a primary cause and a modifier of many human diseases.     A first step to understanding how the ER stress response impacts human disease is to determine how the transcriptional response to ER stress varies among individuals.     The genetic diversity of the eight mouse Collaborative Cross (CC) founder strains allowed us to determine how genetic variation impacts the ER stress transcriptional response.     We used tunicamycin, a drug commonly used to induce ER stress, to elicit an ER stress response in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from the CC founder strains and measured their transcriptional responses.     We identified hundreds of genes that differed in response to ER stress across these genetically diverse strains.     Strikingly, inflammatory response genes differed most between strains; major canonical ER stress response genes showed relatively invariant responses across strains.     To uncover the genetic architecture underlying these strain differences in ER stress response, we measured the transcriptional response to ER stress in MEFs derived from a subset of F1 crosses between the CC founder strains.     We found a unique layer of regulatory variation that is only detectable under ER stress conditions.     Over 80% of the regulatory variation under ER stress derives from cis-regulatory differences.     This is the first study to characterize the genetic variation in ER stress transcriptional response in the laboratory mouse.     Our findings indicate that the ER stress transcriptional response is highly variable among strains and arises from genetic variation in individual downstream response genes, rather than major signaling transcription factors.     These results have important implications for understanding how genetic variation impacts the ER stress response, an important component of many human diseases.     We investigated the genetic variation in ER stress transcriptional response in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) across eight mouse strains: A/J, C57BL/6J, 129S1Sv/ImJ, NOD/ShiLtJ, NZO/H1LtJ, CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ. MEFs from each strain were treated with a control DMSO or ER stress-inducing drug, Tunicamycin (TM). To identify the genetic architecture underlying this genetic variation, MEFs from F1 strains were also studied.     MEFs from the following F1s were evaluated: C57BL/6J X CAST/EiJ, C57BL/6J X 129S1Sv/ImJ, C57BL/6J X NOD/ShiLtJ, C57BL/6J X NZO/H1LtJ, and C57BL/6J X WSB/EiJ. Again F1 MEFS were treated with either DMSO or TM. There are two or three replicates for each sample.

 E-GEOD-50595 - Argonaute-bound small RNAs from promoter-proximal RNA Polymerase II Argonaute (Ago) proteins mediate post-transcriptional gene repression by binding  guide microRNAs (miRNAs) to regulate targeted RNAs. To confidently assess Agobound  small RNAs, we adapted a mouse embryonic stem cell system to express a single  inducible epitope-tagged Ago protein.     Here, we report the small RNA profile of Agodeficient  cells and determine Ago-dependent stability is a common feature of mammalian  miRNAs. Considering both in vivo Ago-dependence for stability and Ago2 binding as  defined by immunopurification, we have identified a novel class of non-canonical  miRNAs derived from protein-coding gene promoters, which we name transcriptional  start site miRNAs (TSS-miRNAs). A subset of promoter-proximal RNA polymerase II  complexes produce hairpin RNAs that are processed in a DGCR8/Drosha-independent,  but Dicer-dependent manner.     TSS-miRNA activity is detectable endogenously, upon  transfection of a mimic or by mRNA overexpression.     Finally, we present evidence of  differential expression and conservation in humans, suggesting important roles in gene  regulation.     Examination of Ago immunoprecipitations and mESC without Ago proteins
 E-GEOD-65935 - Paraoxonase 2 Serves a Proapopotic Function in Mouse and Human Cells in Response to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa Quorum-Sensing Molecule N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-Homoserine Lactone. Pseudomonas aeruginosa use quorum-sensing molecules, including N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-homoserine lactone (C12), for intercellular communication.     C12 activated apoptosis in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) from both wild type (WT) and Bax/Bak double knock-out mice (WT MEF and DKO MEF that were responsive to C12, DKOR MEF): nuclei fragmented; mitochondrial membrane potential (∆ψmito) depolarized; Ca2+ was released from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), increasing cytosolic [Ca2+] (Cacyto); caspase 3/7 was activated.     DKOR MEF had been isolated from a nonclonal pool of DKO MEF that were non-responsive to C12 (DKONR MEF). RNAseq analysis, qPCR and western blots showed that WT and DKOR MEF both expressed genes associated with cancer, including paraoxonase 2 (PON2), while DKONR MEF expressed little PON2. Adenovirus-mediated expression of human PON2 in DKONR MEF rendered them responsive to C12: ∆ψmito depolarized, Cacyto increased and caspase 3/7 activated.     Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells expressed low levels of endogenous PON2, and these cells were also less responsive to C12. Overexpression of PON2, but not PON2-H114Q (no lactonase activity) in HEK293T cells caused them to become sensitive to C12. Because [C12] may reach high levels in biofilms in lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, PON2 lactonase activity may control ∆ψmito, Ca2+ release from the ER and apoptosis in CF airway epithelia.     Coupled with previous data, these results also indicate that PON2 uses its lactonase activity to prevent Bax- and Bak-dependent apoptosis in response to common proapoptotic drugs like doxorubicin, staurosporine but activates Bax- and Bak-independent apoptosis in response to C12. Gene expression profiling of mouse embryo fibroblasts from WT and Bax/Bak double knock-out mice (C12 responsive and non-reponsive cell lines).
 E-GEOD-44764 - The histone demethylase Jmjd3 sequentially associates with the transcription factors Tbx3 and Eomes to drive endoderm differentiation Here we show that T-box proteins team up with chromatin modifying enzymes to drive the expression of the key lineage regulator, Eomes during endodermal differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells.     The Eomes locus is maintained in a transcriptionally poised configuration in ES cells.     During early differentiation steps, the ES cell factor Tbx3 associates with the histone demethylase Jmjd3 at the enhancer element of the Eomes locus to allow enhancer-promoter interactions.     This spatial reorganization of the chromatin primes the cells to respond to Activin signaling, which promotes the binding of Jmjd3 and Eomes to its own bivalent promoter region to further stimulate Eomes expression in a positive feedback loop.     Examination of the binding of pluripotency factors to mouse embryonic stem cells and embryoid bodies
 E-GEOD-46202 - Coordination of engineered factors with TET1/2 promotes early stage epigenetic modification during somatic cell reprogramming Somatic cell reprogramming towards induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) holds great promise in future regenerative medicine, however, the reprogramming process mediated by the traditional defined factors (OSNK) is slow and extremely inefficient.     Here we show that a combination of modified reprogramming factors (OySyNyK), in which the transactivation domain of the Yes-associated protein is fused to OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG respectively, could be used to establish a highly efficient and rapid reprogramming system for iPSC generation.     We show that the efficiency of OySyNyK-induced iPSCs was up to 100-fold higher than that of induction by traditional OSNK. Moreover we show that the reprogramming by OySyNyK is very rapid (initiated at 24 h versus 5 d by OSNK). Compared with OSNK, we found that OySyNyK factors significantly increased the expression of Tet1/2 at the early stage, which will interact with OSNK factors, and co-occupy pluripotency loci in the genome for somatic cell reprogramming.     Our studies not only establish a rapid and highly efficient iPSC reprogramming system, but also uncover a novel mechanism by which OSNK factors coordinate with TET proteins to regulate 5hmC-mediated epigenetic control, thereby promoting somatic cell reprogramming.     We examined DNA hydroxymethylation progression of reprogramming intermediates.     To this end, we profiled the genome-wide 5hmC distribution in MEFs, the reprogramming intermediates at different stages induced by either the OSNK or OySyNyK methods, and iPSCs using the chemical capture approach
 E-MTAB-4331 - RNA-seq of Notch signalling inhibition in NS5 Here we performed a RNA-seq experiment on samples of adherent cultures of mouse neural stem cells (NS5 cell line) under normal growth conditions and after 4 hours of treatment with the gamma-secretase inhibitor LY 411575. This resulted in the generation of a genome-wide mRNA expression pattern and quantification for these cells in the two conditions.
 E-GEOD-57603 - Inflammation-Driven Carcinogenesis is Mediated through STING [MEFs] Chronic stimulation of innate immune pathways by microbial agents or damaged tissue is known to promote inflammation-driven tumorigenesis by unclarified mechanisms1-3. Here we demonstrate that mutagenic 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA), etoposide or cisplatin induces nuclear DNA leakage into the cytosol to intrinsically activate STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes) dependent cytokine production.     Inflammatory cytokine levels were subsequently augmented in a STING-dependent extrinsic manner by infiltrating phagocytes purging dying cells.     Consequently, STING-/- mice, or wild type mice adoptively transferred with STING-/- bone marrow, were almost completely resistant to DMBA-induced skin carcinogenesis compared to their wild type counterparts.     Our data emphasizes, for the first time, a role for STING in the induction of cancer, sheds significant insight into the causes of inflammation-driven carcinogenesis, and may provide therapeutic strategies to help prevent malignant disease Total RNA obtained from wild type murine embryonic fibroblasts (WT MEFs), STING deficient MEFs (SKO), Trex1 deficient MEFs (TKO), and both STING and Trex1 deficient MEFs (STKO) treated with DMBA and examined cytokine production by these cells.
 E-GEOD-44733 - mRNA-seq in DNA methylation deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts DNA methylation and the Polycomb Repression System are epigenetic mechanisms that play important roles in maintaining transcriptional repression.     Recent evidence suggests that DNA methylation can attenuate the binding of Polycomb protein components to chromatin and thus plays a role in determining their genomic targeting.     However, whether this role of DNA methylation is important in the context of transcriptional regulation is unclear.     By genome-wide mapping of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-signature histone mark, H3K27me3, in severely DNA hypomethylated mouse somatic cells, we show that hypomethylation leads to widespread H3K27me3 redistribution, in a manner that reflects the local DNA methylation status in wild-type cells.     Unexpectedly, we observe striking loss of H3K27me3 and PRC2 from Polycomb-target gene promoters in DNA hypomethylated cells, including Hox gene clusters.     Importantly, we show that many of these genes become ectopically expressed in DNA hypomethylated cells, consistent with loss of Polycomb-mediated repression.     An intact DNA methylome is required for appropriate Polycomb-mediated gene repression by constraining PRC2 targeting.     These observations identify a previously unappreciated role for DNA methylation in gene regulation and therefore influence our understanding of how this epigenetic mechanism contributes to normal development and disease.     comparison of Dnmt1+/+ vs Dnmt1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts by strand-specific mRNA-seq
 E-GEOD-44757 - DNA methylation profiling by HELP-seq in Dnmt1+/+ mouse embryonic fibroblasts DNA methylation and the Polycomb Repression System are epigenetic mechanisms that play important roles in maintaining transcriptional repression.     Recent evidence suggests that DNA methylation can attenuate the binding of Polycomb protein components to chromatin and thus plays a role in determining their genomic targeting.

 E-GEOD-18463 - The effects of Hmgb1 depletion on gene expression in murine cells High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) is a highly abundant and evolutionarily conserved non-histone chromatin component with the ability to bind and bend DNA. The protein is involved in fundamental nuclear processes including nucleosome sliding, transcription, replication, V(D)J recombination and DNA transposition.     To assess the functional impact of HMGB1 on transcription we performed gene expression profile analyses of mouse embryonic fibroblasts, wild-type or knockout for the Hmgb1 gene 2 genetic backgrounds: wild-type (Wt), Hmgb1-/- (KO), 3 biological replicates (rep1, rep2, rep3; S phase synchronized cells in duplicate only), no technical replicates.     Each pair of wt and Hmgb1-/- MEFs was isolated from embryos born from a single Hmgb1+/- mother crossed with a Hmgb1 +/- male.     Total RNAs from three pairs of MEFs, derived from three different mothers and cultured up to passage 3, were extracted using mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion)  and analyzed on the Illumina BeadsArray platform.
 E-GEOD-48666 - CpG island-mediated global gene regulatory modes in mouse embryonic stem cells In order to identify the regions occupied by transcription factors, we performed bio-ChIP followed by massive parallel sequencing (bioChIP-Seq) in mouse ES cells.     A total of seven DNA transcription factors including Myc module (Myc, Max, E2F4, Tip60 and Dmap1) and Core module transcription factors (Nanog, Dax1; Kim et al., 2010) were identified.     We show that the transcription factors can be classified into several classes according to their occupancies.     Our data also show transcription factors in the same class co-occupy the same regulatory elements, share the common characteristics and act together.     Identification of seven transcription factor binding sites in mES cells
 E-GEOD-61694 - MEF OSK O KS T20 Next Generation Sequencing with differdent pluripotent transcript factor overexpression in MEF Somatic cells can be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by defined factors.     The low efficiency of reprogramming limited the potential application of iPSCs. Here we found that knockdown LSD1 , which demethylates histone H3 Lys 4 or 9 , could increase iPSCs generation.     It has been reported that LSD1 interaction with Oct4 which is the core factor of reprogramming.     So we try to find out the different of overexpression Oct4 or Kllf4/Sox2 in MEF and LSD1 inhibitor.     Retrovirus-mediated different pluripotent transcript factor overexpression in MEF cells after 4 days collect mRNA profiles processing with Illumina MiSeq; MEF, Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast O, MEF infected with Oct4 KS,MEF infected with Klf4 and Sox2 OSK, MEF infected with Oct4 Klf4 and Sox2 T20, MEF infected with Oct4 Klf4 and Sox2 and treated with 20nm LSD1 inhibitor Tranylcypromine
 E-GEOD-27903 - The effects of the 5' pocket motif of Dicer on miRNA biogenesis A hallmark of RNA silencing is a class of ~22 nt RNAs which are processed from dsRNA precursor by Dicer.     Accurate processing by Dicer is critical for the functionality of microRNAs (miRNAs). According to the current model, Dicer measures the length by anchoring the 3' overhang of the dsRNA terminus.     Here we find that human Dicer binds to the 5' end of RNA and utilizes the 5' end as an additional reference point for cleavage site selection (5' counting rule). We further identify a novel motif (5'-pocket) in Dicer, which recognizes the 5' end of RNA. By analyzing miRNA population from 5'-pocket mutant Dicer expressing Dicer-null mES, we provide that the 5' pocket is significant for Dicer processing in vivo.     Examination of small RNA profiles from Dicer-null mouse embryonic stem cells transfected with either wild-type or 5' pocket mutant Dice expression plasmids.
 E-GEOD-57231 - Detained introns are novel, widespread class of posttranscriptionally-spliced introns Removal of introns by pre-mRNA splicing is a critical and in some cases rate-limiting step in mammalian gene expression.      Deep sequencing of mouse embryonic stem cell RNA revealed many specific internal introns that are significantly more abundant than the other introns within poly(A) selected  transcripts; we classify these as “detained” introns (DIs). We identified thousands of DIs flanking both constitutive and alternatively spliced exons in human and mouse cell lines.     Drug inhibition of Clk SR-protein kinase activity triggered rapid splicing changes in a specific set of DIs, about half of which showed increased splicing and half increased intron detention, altering the transcript pool of over 300 genes.      These data suggest a widespread mechanism by which a nuclear detained pool of mostly processed pre-mRNAs can be rapidly mobilized in response to stress or homeostatic autoregulation.     v6.5 mouse embryonic stem cells were untreated, treated with the Clk kinase inhibitor KH-CB19, or treated with DMSO as a negative control.      Untreated cells were harvested and a single replicate was sequenced using a custom, ligation-based, stranded library preparation protocol.      Treated cells were harvested at time 0 and at 2 hours post-treatment, and poly(A)-selected RNA-seq libraries were made from biological duplicates for each treatment/time, barcoded, and sequenced by strand-specific, paired-end sequencing using the Illumina TruSeq kit.
 E-GEOD-47893 - Maintenance of DNA methylation in embryonic stem cells depends on the histone H3K9 methyltransferases (Dnmt3ab KO Methyl-Seq) During mammalian development DNA methylation patterns need to be reset in primordial germ cells (PGC) and preimplantation embryos.     However, many retro-transposons and imprinted genes are resistant to such global epigenetic reprogramming via hitherto undefined mechanisms.     Here, we report that some of these sequences are immune to widespread erasure of DNA methylation in the mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) lacking de novo DNA methyltransferases.     Persistence of DNA methylation at these loci in mESCs depends on the histone H3K9 methyltransferase Setdb1, as deletion of Setdb1 results in reduction of H3K9me3 and DNA methylation levels concomitant with an increase in 5-hydroxymethylation (5hmC). In addition, depletion of H3K9 methyltransferase G9a leads to genome-wide reduction of DNA methylation but to a lesser extent at the above sequences.     Taken together, these data reveal that Setdb1 ensures the fidelity of DNA methylation at specific loci in mESCs, which may reflect mechanisms functioning in vivo during key developmental stages.     Examination of genome-wide DNA methylation status in 2 cell types.
 E-GEOD-65734 - Comprehensive role of Zfp217 in m6A methylation [MeRIP-seq] Many transcriptional and epigenetic networks must be integrated to maintain self-renewal and pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and to enable induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming.      Here, we explore the role of Zfp217 as a key transcriptional factor in maintaining ES cell self-renewal by performing meRIP analysis in control and Zfp217-depleted mouse stem cells.     Examination of m6A levels from total RNA in control and Zfp217 shRNA infected mouse stem cells
 E-MTAB-3784 - RNA-seq of mouse embryonic stem cells differentiated to EpiSCs and further to presomitic mesoderm (PSM) via Wnt activation (CHIR99021) to study the influence of FGF signaling on PSM induction Presomitic mesoderm (PSM) cells are the precursors of the somites, which flank both sides of the neural tube and give rise to the musculo-skeletal system shaping the vertebrate body.     WNT and FGF signalling control the formation of both the PSM and the somites, and show a graded distribution with highest levels in the posterior PSM. We have employed reporter for the PSM control gene Tbx6 to investigate the differentiation of mouse ESCs from the naĂŻve state to PSM state.     Feeder-free ESCs were seeded and grown on fibronectin (3-5 ng/ml)-coated plates in ESC medium containing LIF, PD0325901 and CHIR99021 (2i medium) to bring them to a naive state of pluripotency.     Following this, the cells were brought to an EpiSC state by treating them with Activin A and FGF2. The EpiSC-like cells were then differentiated to PSM using CHIR99021 either alone or along with FGF ligands, FGF2 or FGF8 (Low concentration: 10 ng/ml or High concentration: 250ng/ml).

 E-GEOD-21768 - Klf4 gene disruption is linked to enhanced cellular proliferation and tumor formation Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) is involved in diverse biological processes such as cell cycle control, differentiation, transcriptional regulation, DNA repair and apoptosis.     Furthermore, KLF4 is a tumor suppressor and play a role in regulating genomic stability.     In order to investigate the changes in gene expression in the klf4 null MEFs, we compared the gene expression patterns of the wild type and klf4 null by microarray.     Total RNA isolated from Klf4 -/- MEFs compared to Klf4 +/+ MEFs. RNA was processed from cells that had reached 80-90 confluency in triplicate using Trizol reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). RNA was subjected to DNase I treatment in order to remove any contaminating genomic DNA. Final purification was performed on RNAeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
 E-GEOD-60763 - CRISPR reveals a distal murine-specific enhancer required for Sox2 expression in mouse embryonic stem cells The pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is maintained by a small group of master transcription factors including Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog.     These core factors form a regulatory circuit controlling the transcription of a number of pluripotency factors including themselves.     Although a lot of previous studies have identified key factors regulating this core network in trans, the contribution of cis-regulatory DNA sequences on the transcription of these key pluripotency factors remains elusive.     We analyzed epigenomic data within the 1.5 Mb gene-desert regions around Sox2 gene and predicted only one 13kb-long enhancer located 100kb downstream of Sox2 in mouse ES cells.     This enhancer is occupied by Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and mediator complex and forms a long-range DNA looping to Sox2 locus.     We hypothesized that this enhancer is critical for Sox2 gene expression and tested this hypothesis by deleting this entire 13-kb enhancer with a simple highly-efficient double-excision CRISPR strategy.     Allele-specific of Sox2 transcripts in heterozygous enhancer-deletion clones showed that the enhancer affects expression through a cis-acting mechanism.     Strikingly, although this distal enhancer is not conserved in other mammals including human, it is responsible for over 90% of Sox2 expression in mouse ESCs. Taken together, our results provide direct evidence that in mouse ESCs, Sox2 transcription is primarily driven by a species-specific distal enhancer, which may provide new perspectives explaining the physiological difference between human and mouse ES cells.     This dataset include ChIP-seq of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac in a hybrid mouse ES cells (F123). H3K27ac in J1 mouse ES cells.     And RNA-seq in F123 mESCs with complete Sox2 enhancer deletion or enhancer haploinsufficient clones.
 E-GEOD-60192 - Genome-wide identification and characterization of functional neuronal activity-dependent enhancers Experience-dependent gene transcription is required for nervous system development and function.      However, the DNA regulatory elements that control this program of gene expression are not well defined.      Here we characterize the enhancers that function across the genome to mediate activity-dependent transcription in neurons.     While ~12,000 putative activity-regulated enhancer sequences have previously been identified that are enriched for H3K4me1 and the histone acetyltransferase CBP, we find that this chromatin signature is not sufficient to distinguish which of these regulatory sequences are actively engaged in promoting activity-dependent transcription.     We show here that a subset of H3K4me1/CBP positive enhancers that is enriched for H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) in vivo, and shows increased H3K27ac upon membrane depolarization of cortical neurons, function to regulate activity-dependent transcription.      The function of many of these activity-regulated enhancers appears to be dependent on the binding of FOS, a protein that had previously been thought to interact primarily with the promoters of activity-regulated genes.      Furthermore, many of these target genes in cortical neurons encode neuron specific proteins that regulate synaptic development and function.      These findings suggest that FOS functions at enhancers to control activity-dependent gene programs that are critical for nervous system function, and provide a resource of activity-dependent enhancers that may give insight into genetic variation that contributes to brain development and disease.     Genome-wide maps of H3K27ac and AP1 transcription factors (CFOS, FOSB, JUNB) before and after neuronal activity in mouse cortical neurons.
 E-GEOD-44149 - Chip-chip for H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 in DNA methylation deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts DNA methylation and the Polycomb Repression System are epigenetic mechanisms that play important roles in maintaining transcriptional repression.

 E-MTAB-2268 - RNA-seq of coding RNA from mouse embryonic stem cells exposed to a sequence of extrinsic signals Exposure of mouse ESCs to a sequence of extrinsic signals, which recapitulates in vivo development, generates a bipotential neuromesodermal precursor (NMP) that can be directed to differentiate into either spinal cord or paraxial mesodermal tissue.     To induce differentiation,mouse ES cells were plated on CellBINDSurface dishes (Corning) precoated with 0.1% gelatin (Sigma) at a density of 5x10^3 cells cm-2 in N2B27 medium.     Cells were grown in N2B27 supplemented with 10ng/ml bFGF (R&D) for 3 days (D1-D3) and then were transferred into serum free media without bFGF (D3-D5).  To induce ventral hindbrain identity NPCs (NH) 100nM RA (Sigma) and 500nM SAG (Calbiochem) was added from D3-D5. Spinal cord identity (NP) was induced by the addition of 5nM CHIR 99021 (Axon) from D2 to D3 followed by 100nM RA, 500nM SAG from D3-D5. To induce mesodermal differentiation the cells were treated with CHIR99021 from D2-D5.
 E-GEOD-44088 - Gene expression profiling to recognize specific features of non-genotoxic carcinogens The current test strategy for carcinogenicity is generally based on in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity assays.     Non-genotoxic carcinogens (NGTXC) are negative for genotoxicity and go undetected.     Therefore, alternative tests to detect these chemicals are urgently needed.     NGTXC act through different modes of action, which complicates the development of such assays.     We have demonstrated recently in primary mouse hepatocytes that some, but certainly not all, NGTXC can be categorized according to their mode of action based on feature detection at a gene expression level (Schaap et al. 2012 (PMID 22710402)). Identification of a wider range of chemicals probably requires multiple in vitro systems.     In the current study, we describe the added value of using mouse embryonic stem cells.     In this study, the focus is on NGTXC, but we also included genotoxic carcinogens and non-carcinogens.     This approach enables us to assess the robustness of this method and to evaluate the system for recognizing features of chemicals in general, which is important for application in future risk assessment.     Primary mouse hepatocytes and mouse embryonic stem cells were exposed to 26 chemicals (non-genotoxic carcinogens and non-carcinogens) representing diverse modes of action.     Upon profiling, an unsupervised comparison approach was applied to recognize similar features at the transcriptomic level.      This Series consists of the gene expression data of the primary mouse hepatocytes.     The expression data of the mouse embryonic stem cells is submitted separately under another accession number.     In this study we tested 26 chemicals of which 16 non-genotoxic carcinogens, 4 genotoxic carcinogens, 2 genotoxic non-carcinogens and 4 non-carcinogens.     Specification of the chemicals can be found in the readme file.
 E-GEOD-55040 - Haploinsufficiency of an RB-E2F1-Condensin II complex causes replication stress and contributes to mesenchymal cancers [CAP-D3 localization] Genome instability is a characteristic of malignant cells, however, evidence for its contribution to tumorigenesis has been enigmatic.     In this study we demonstrate that a complex containing the retinoblastoma protein, E2F1, and Condensin II localizes to major satellite repeats at pericentromeres.     In the absence of this complex, this genomic region fails to properly replicate and H2AX phosphorylation at pericentromeric repeats is increased.     Our data indicates that these lesions contribute to defective chromosome segregation in the ensuing mitosis.     Surprisingly, loss of even one copy of the retinoblastoma gene was sufficient to reduce recruitment of Condensin II to pericentromeres and cause this phenotype.     Furthermore, we determined that human RB1 mutation status in cancers of mesenchymal origin correlated with copy number variation, chromosomal gains and losses, as well as chromothriptic rearrangements.     Importantly, the magnitude of these chromosomal abnormalities was indistinguishable between RB1+/- and RB1-/- genotypes.     Lastly, using gene-targeted mice we determined that mutation of just one copy of the murine Rb1 gene causes sarcomas and lymphomas with increased chromosome copy number variation.     Our study connects replication stress with a number of common chromosomal abnormalities in cancer through a dosage sensitive complex present at pericentromeric repeats.     CAP-D3 localization was studied in two different genotypes: Rb+/+ and RbΔL/ΔL. As a control, input from the ChIP experiment was also sequenced.     The CAP-D3 antibody used was raised against a GST fusion protein containing amino acids 1243-1506 (Coschi et al., 2010).
 E-GEOD-33823 - X-chromosome hyperactivation in mammals via nonlinear relationships between chromatin states and transcription Dosage compensation in mammals occurs at two levels.     In addition to balancing X-chromosome dosage between males and females via X-inactivation, mammals also balance dosage of Xs and autosomes.     It has been proposed that X-autosome equalization occurs by upregulation of Xa (active X). To investigate the mechanism, we perform allele-specific ChIP-seq for chromatin epitopes and analyze RNA-seq data (SRA010053). The hypertranscribed Xa demonstrates enrichment of active chromatin marks relative to autosomes.     We derive predictive models for relationships among Pol II, active mark densities and gene expression, and we suggest that Xa upregulation involves increased transcription initiation and elongation.     Enrichment of active marks on Xa does not scale proportionally with transcription output, a disparity explained by nonlinear quantitative dependencies among active histone marks, Pol II occupancy and transcription.     Notably, the trend of nonlinear upregulation also occurs on autosomes.     Thus, Xa upregulation involves combined increases of active histone marks and Pol II occupancy, without invoking X-specific dependencies between chromatin states and transcription.     Examination of 4 marks of active transcription (H3K4me3, H3K36me3, POL-II-S2P, POL-II-S5P) in a transformed female mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line (EY.T4).
 E-GEOD-47887 - Maintenance of DNA methylation in embryonic stem cells depends on the histone H3K9 methyltransferases (K9 KO ChIP-Seq) During mammalian development DNA methylation patterns need to be reset in primordial germ cells (PGC) and preimplantation embryos.     However, many retro-transposons and imprinted genes are resistant to such global epigenetic reprogramming via hitherto undefined mechanisms.

In addition, depletion of H3K9 methyltransferase G9a leads to genome-wide reduction of DNA methylation but to a lesser extent at the above sequences.     Taken together, these data reveal that Setdb1 ensures the fidelity of DNA methylation at specific loci in mESCs, which may reflect mechanisms functioning in vivo during key developmental stages.     Examination of H3K9me3 histone modifications in 2 cell types.
 E-GEOD-47123 - Extended self-renewal and accelerated reprogramming in the absence of Kdm5b [ChIP-Seq] ES cell pluripotency is thought to be regulated in part by H3K4 methylation.     However, it is unclear how H3K4 demethylation contributes to ES cell function and participates in iPS cell reprogramming.     Here, we show that KDM5B, which demethylates H3K4, is important for ES cell differentiation, and presents a barrier to the reprogramming process.     Depletion of Kdm5b leads to an extension in the self-renewal of ES cells in the absence of LIF. Transcriptome analysis revealed the persistent expression of pluripotency-genes and underexpression of developmental genes during differentiation in the absence of Kdm5b, suggesting that KDM5B plays a key role in cellular fate changes.     We also observed accelerated reprogramming of differentiated cells in the absence of Kdm5b, demonstrating that KDM5B is a barrier to the reprogramming process.     Expression analysis revealed that mesenchymal master regulators associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are downregulated during reprogramming in the absence of Kdm5b. Moreover, global analysis of H3K4me3/2 revealed that enhancers of fibroblast genes are rapidly deactivated in the absence of Kdm5b, and genes associated with EMT lose H3K4me3/2 during the early reprogramming process.     These findings provide functional insight into the role for KDM5B in regulating ES cell differentiation and as a barrier to the reprogramming process.     ChIP-Seq for H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 in murine shLuc and shKdm5b 4TF-MEFs (tetO-Pou5f1,-Sox2,-Klf4,-c-Myc) at 48h.
 E-GEOD-49848 - Genome-wide mapping of Klf4 and Klf5 in pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) We identified the binding profile of Klf4 and Klf5, which are both transcription facyors involved in the maintenance of pluripotency of ESCs by inhibiting their differentiation either into endoderm or mesoderm respectively.     Undifferentiated mouse ESCs were used to identify Klf4 and Klf5 bidning sites

 E-GEOD-50856 - Technical Variations in Low-Input RNA-seq Methodologies Transcriptomics data obtained from limiting amounts of mRNA is often noisy, providing primarily qualitative changes in transcript expressions.     So far, technical variations arising out of the library preparation protocols have not been adequately characterized at reduced levels of mRNA. Here, we generated sequencing libraries from limiting amounts of mRNA using three amplification-based methods, viz.     Smart-seq, DP-seq and CEL-seq, and demonstrated significant technical variations in these libraries.     Reduction in mRNA levels led to inefficient amplification of the majority of low to moderately expressed transcripts.     Furthermore, stochasticity in primer hybridization and/or enzyme incorporation was magnified during the amplification step resulting in significant distortions in fold changes of the transcripts.     Consequently, the majority of the differentially expressed transcripts identified were either high-expressed and/or exhibited high fold changes.     High technical variations, which were sequencing depth independent, ultimately masked subtle biological differences mandating the development of improved amplification-based strategies for quantitative transcriptomics from limiting amounts of mRNA. Sequencing libraries were prepared from serial dilutions of mRNA, ranging from 1 ng to 25 pg, using three amplification-based methods, viz.     Smart-seq, DP-seq and CEL-seq.     The mRNA was derived from an in vitro model of lineage segregation achieved by modulating TGF beta signaling pathway in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells.
 E-GEOD-74646 - Comprehensive Identification of Long Non-coding RNAs in Purified Cell Types from the Brain Reveals Functional LncRNA in OPC Fate Determination (OLIG2 Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) in mouse neural stem cells) To better understand the OLIG2 binding site in the whole-genome of mouse neural stem cells, ChIP was performed using 107 mouse neural stem cells.     The ChIP-Seq library was constructed by using DNA SMART ChIP-Seq Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech) and was sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 Sequencer.     OLIG2 Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) in mouse neural stem cell.
 E-GEOD-68902 - Direct Induction of Neurons from Various Cell Types by Chemical Defined Medium We have developed a serum-free chemical defined medium, namely 6C, that can directly convert mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEFs), glia cells into neurons in vitro.     Human cells such as human foreskin fibroblast(HHFs), Hela cells and born marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-hMSC) can also be converted into neuron-like cells by this medium with some modification such as including several other small molecules.     To understand the possible mechanisms, the transdifferentiation of MEFs by 6C was chosen as a model system and gene profiling at different time point during the conversion was carried out by RNA sequencing using Illumina MiSeq. MEFs was maintained in MEF medium (DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1mM Glutamax and 100X NEAA), to start the induction, the culture medium was shift to 6C and marked as day 0, neurons could be generated in day 15. mRNA samples was collected at day 0, 2, 5, 10, 15 during the process, with cell lysed by Trizol and mRNA enriched by Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation v2 kit.     We find that most cell cycle related genes were up regulated during the first few days of induction, while many Notch pathway genes up regulated during the later phase of this process.     The RNA sequencing data provided important cues for further study on the mechanisms of the direct neuronal induction process.     Gene profiling at different time point during the transdifferentiation mediated by 6C medium.
 E-GEOD-33791 - The SNF2-like helicase HELLS mediates E2F3-dependent transcription and cellular transformation The activating E2F-transcription factors are best known for their dependence on the Retinoblastoma protein and their role in cellular proliferation.     E2F3 is uniquely amplified in specific human tumours where its expression is inversely correlated with the survival of patients.     Here, E2F3 interaction partners were identified by mass spectrometric analysis.     We show that the SNF2-like HELLS interacts with E2F3 in vivo and cooperates with its oncogenic functions.     Depletion of HELLS severely perturbs the induction of E2F-target genes, hinders cell cycle re-entry and growth.     Using chromatin immmunoprecipitation coupled to sequencing we identified genome-wide targets of HELLS and E2F3. Our analysis revealed that HELLS binds near promoters of active genes, including the trithorax-related MLL1, and co-regulates E2F3-dependent genes.     Our analysis is the first to link HELLS with E2F-controlled processes that are critical to establish a proliferative tumour circuitry.     Strikingly, just as E2F3, HELLS is overexpressed in human tumours including prostate cancer, indicating that either factor may contribute to the malignant progression of tumours.     Our work reveals that HELLS is important for E2F3 in tumour cell proliferation.     Examination of E2F3, Hells, and H3K27me3 in 2 cell types.
 E-GEOD-58818 - Meis1 induces and Prep1 suppresses tumors by exploiting low affinity AP1 binding sites. We have defined the tumor and tumor suppressor signature for Meis1 and Prep1 (pKnox1), respectively, using ChIP-seq and RNA-seq in a cell system in which tumor suppressor Prep1 and oncogene Meis1 compete for tumorigenesis [GSE54221; GSE58802]. In this paper we report that the number of Meis1 or Prep1 DNA binding sites increases linearly with the level of expression of the two transcription factors.     Overexpression of Meis1 induces tumors.     At the molecular level it modifies the DNA target specificity by increasing the number of low-affinity binding sites, which results in a different choice of consensus sequences with predominance of sites normally bound by the AP1 transcription factor family.     Upon concomitant overexpression of Prep1 and Meis1 tumorigenesis is inhibited.     Prep1 dominates over Meis1 not only because it partially decreases Meis1 protein level but also because it prevents the binding to a substantial fraction of the low affinity binding sites.     Overall, overexpression of Prep1 reverses the nature of the bound and regulated genes from stimulatory to inhibitory of signal transduction and transcription, which suppresses tumorigenesis.     By identifying the Meis1 tumor signature, specific relevant signaling pathways are identified.     In line with these results, tumorigenic Meis1-overexpressing cells are uniquely hypersensitive to inhibitors of the MAPK/Akt pathways.     Examination of Prep1 and Meis1 in five cell type
 E-GEOD-56151 - Genome-wide analysis of H3K4me1 in Lsh-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts We report here differentiated enrichment of H3K4me1 at Lsh WT and KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). We found a subset of differentially enriched H3K4me1 regions in Lsh KO MEFs, and they clustered at neuronal lineage genes and overlapping with known cis-regulatory elements present in brain tissue.     Reprogramming of Lsh−/− MEFs into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells leads to increased neuronal lineage gene expression of premarked genes and enhanced differentiation potential of Lsh−/− iPS cells toward the neuronal lineage pathway compared with WT iPS cells in vitro and in vivo.     The state of H3K4me1 enrichment is partially maintained in Lsh−/− iPS cells, suggesting the regions are preserved as potential enhancers.     Genome-wide maps of H3K4me1 in Lsh WT and KO primary MEFs.
 E-GEOD-57153 - Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β phosphorylates and protects nuclear myosin 1c from proteasome-mediated degradation to activate rDNA transcription in early G1 cells Nuclear myosin 1c (NM1) mediates RNA polymerase I (pol I) transcription activation and cell cycle progression by facilitating PCAF-mediated H3K9 acetylation, but the molecular mechanism by which NM1 is regulated remains unclear.     Here, we report that at early G1 the glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β phosphorylates and stabilizes NM1, allowing for NM1 association with the chromatin.     Genomic analysis by ChIP-Seq showed that this mechanism occurs on the rDNA as active GSK3β selectively occupies the gene.     ChIP assays and transmission electron microscopy in GSK3β-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts indicated that at G1 rRNA synthesis is suppressed due to decreased H3K9 acetylation leading to a chromatin state incompatible with transcription.     We found that GSK3β directly phosphorylates the endogenous NM1 on a single serine residue (Ser-1020) located within the NM1 C-terminus.     In G1 this phosphorylation event stabilizes NM1 and prevents NM1 polyubiquitination by the E3 ligase UBR5 and proteasome-mediated degradation.     We conclude that GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of NM1 is required for pol I transcription activation.     Examination of GSK3beta with the genome in mouse embryonic fibroblasts
 E-GEOD-51170 - Identification of building principles of methylation states at CG rich regions by high-throughput editing of a mammalian genome Methylation is a repressive modification of DNA prevalent throughout mammalian genomes yet mostly absent at CG rich stretches referred to as CGI. Here we identify their building principles by parallel genomic targeting of sequence libraries.      Iterative insertions generated over 3,000 variants of genome-derived and artificial sequences at the same genomic site.      Single molecule profiling of the methylation status of this collection allowed modeling the contribution of CG content and DNA binding factors towards the unmethylated state.     It made the surprising prediction that the majority of CGs within endogenous islands are susceptible to methylation changes modulated by the presence of transcription factors, which is indeed confirmed by genome-wide methylation dynamics during multiple cellular differentiations.       Our model further predicts blocks of constitutively unmethylated CGs independent from TF binding, which have a median size of ~300bp but are only present in half of all islands.     Their constitutively unmethylated state is a hallmark of untransformed cells but their increased methylation is a specific and predictive feature of cancer.       This study quantifies the two principal mechanisms governing methylation patterns in mammalian genomes.     It provides a framework to interpret methylation data across normal and cancer samples and refines the concept of CpG islands.

This study quantifies the two principal mechanisms governing methylation patterns in mammalian genomes.     It provides a framework to interpret methylation data across normal and cancer samples and refines the concept of CpG islands.     Libraries of DNA sequences were constructed either by mouse genome (129S6) or E.coli genome (NC 010473.1) subrepresentation or custom synthesis.     DNA fragments were inserted into the genome of mouse embryonic stem cells by recombination mediated casette exchange (RMCE) at the B-globin locus.     Methylation status of the inserted DNA sequences was profiled by bisulfite sequencing using a pair of universal primers flanking the fragments.
 E-GEOD-36123 - Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in VAV1-/- versus VAV1+/+ bone marrow (BM)-macrophages Analysis of differential gene expression profiles in VAV1-/- versus VAV+/+ BM-macrophages , respectively.     A distinct expression profile in VAV1-/- versus VAV1+/+ (wild-type) BM-macrophages  allows to resolve molecular mechanisms.     Total RNA was obtained froms BM-macrophages of VAV1+/+ and VAV1-/- mice
 E-GEOD-44276 - Comparison of gene expression in Dnmt1+/+ MEFs treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine or vector control DNA methylation and the Polycomb Repression System are epigenetic mechanisms that play important roles in maintaining transcriptional repression.     Recent evidence suggests that DNA methylation can attenuate the binding of Polycomb protein components to chromatin and thus plays a role in determining their genomic targeting.     However, whether this role of DNA methylation is important in the context of transcriptional regulation is unclear.     By genome-wide mapping of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-signature histone mark, H3K27me3, in severely DNA hypomethylated mouse somatic cells, we show that hypomethylation leads to widespread H3K27me3 redistribution, in a manner that reflects the local DNA methylation status in wild-type cells.     Unexpectedly, we observe striking loss of H3K27me3 and PRC2 from Polycomb-target gene promoters in DNA hypomethylated cells, including Hox gene clusters.     Importantly, we show that many of these genes become ectopically expressed in DNA hypomethylated cells, consistent with loss of Polycomb-mediated repression.     An intact DNA methylome is required for appropriate Polycomb-mediated gene repression by constraining PRC2 targeting.     These observations identify a previously unappreciated role for DNA methylation in gene regulation and therefore influence our understanding of how this epigenetic mechanism contributes to normal development and disease.     Two biological replicates are compared, each consisting of two technical replicates
 E-GEOD-48172 - Mll2 branch of the COMPASS family regulates bivalent promoters in mouse embryonic stem cells Promoters of many developmentally regulated genes, in the embryonic stem cell state, have a bivalent mark of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, proposed to confer precise temporal activation upon differentiation.     Although Polycomb repressive complex 2 is known to implement H3K27 trimethylation, the COMPASS family member responsible for H3K4me3 at bivalently marked promoters was previously unknown.     Here, we identify Mll2 (KMT2b) as the enzyme catalyzing H3K4 trimethylation at bivalently marked promoters in embryonic stem cells.     Although H3K4me3 at bivalent genes is proposed to prime future activation, we detected no substantial defect in rapid transcriptional induction after retinoic acid treatment in Mll2-depleted cells.     Our identification of the Mll2 complex as the COMPASS family member responsible for H3K4me3 marking at bivalent promoters provides an opportunity to reevaluate and experimentally test models for the function of bivalency in the embryonic stem cell state and in differentiation.     ChIP-Seq in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells for MLL2. ChIP-seq of H3K4me1, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 for mES cells with RNAi against MLL2(shMLL2) and control (shGFP). ChIP-seq of H3K4me3 in mES cells with RNAi against MLL3 (shMLL3). RNA-seq of mES cells with RNAi against MLL2 and control (shGFP). RNA-seq of control mES cells (shGFP) or MLL2 RNAi mES cells (shMLL2) induced with RA for 6h and 12h.
 E-GEOD-47878 - Maintenance of DNA methylation in embryonic stem cells depends on the histone H3K9 methyltransferases (Dnmt3ab KO ChIP-Seq) During mammalian development DNA methylation patterns need to be reset in primordial germ cells (PGC) and preimplantation embryos.     However, many retro-transposons and imprinted genes are resistant to such global epigenetic reprogramming via hitherto undefined mechanisms.     Here, we report that some of these sequences are immune to widespread erasure of DNA methylation in the mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) lacking de novo DNA methyltransferases.     Persistence of DNA methylation at these loci in mESCs depends on the histone H3K9 methyltransferase Setdb1, as deletion of Setdb1 results in reduction of H3K9me3 and DNA methylation levels concomitant with an increase in 5-hydroxymethylation (5hmC). In addition, depletion of H3K9 methyltransferase G9a leads to genome-wide reduction of DNA methylation but to a lesser extent at the above sequences.     Taken together, these data reveal that Setdb1 ensures the fidelity of DNA methylation at specific loci in mESCs, which may reflect mechanisms functioning in vivo during key developmental stages.     Examination of H3K9me3 histone modifications in 2 cell types.
 E-GEOD-34546 - Endogenous mammalian histone H3.3 exhibits chromatin-related functions during development Background.     The histone variant H3.3 plays key roles in regulating chromatin states and transcription.     However, the role of endogenous H3.3 in mammalian cells and during development has been less thoroughly investigated.     To address this gap, we report the production and phenotypic analysis of mice and cells with targeted disruption of the H3.3-encoding gene, H3f3b. Results.     H3f3b KO mice exhibit a semi-lethal phenotype traceable at least in part to defective cell division and chromosome segregation.     H3f3b KO cells have widespread ectopic CENP-A protein localization suggesting one possible mechanism for defective chromosome segregation.     KO cells have abnormal karyotypes and cell cycle profiles as well.     The transcriptome and euchromatin-related epigenome were moderately affected by loss of H3f3b in MEFs with ontology most notably pointing to changes in chromatin regulatory and histone coding genes.     Reduced numbers of H3f3b KO mice survive to maturity and almost all survivors from both sexes are infertile.     Conclusions.     Taken together, our studies suggest that endogenous mammalian histone H3.3 has important roles in regulating chromatin and chromosome functions that in turn are important for cell division, genome integrity, and development.      Examination of H3K9Ac and H3K4me3 in wild-type and H3.3 null MEFs
 E-GEOD-74643 - Comprehensive Identification of Long Non-coding RNAs in Purified Cell Types from the Brain Reveals Functional LncRNA in OPC Fate Determination (RNA-Seq of mouse neural stem cells) To better understand the transcriptome of mouse neural stem cells (including known genes and novel long non coding RNA genes),  RNA-Seq was performed on the polyadenylated fraction of RNA isolated from cell samples.     Read mapping and transcriptome construction were done by using optimized pipeline which integrate Tophat followed by Cufflinks.     mRNA profiles of mouse neural stem cells were generated by RNA-sequencing.
 E-GEOD-65733 - Comprehensive role of Zfp217 in m6A methylation [RIP-seq] Many transcriptional and epigenetic networks must be integrated to maintain self-renewal and pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and to enable induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming.      Here, we explore the role of Zfp217and Mettl3 as RNA-binding proteins.     Identification and characterization of RNAs associated with Zfp217 and Mettl3 in mouse embryoinc stem cells
 E-GEOD-47883 - Maintenance of DNA methylation in embryonic stem cells depends on the histone H3K9 methyltransferases (Dnmt3ab KO RNA-Seq) During mammalian development DNA methylation patterns need to be reset in primordial germ cells (PGC) and preimplantation embryos.

 E-GEOD-25626 - Initiation Pausing of 80S Ribosome on mRNA Is Governed by 5'UTR and Responsive to mTORC1 Signaling (RNA-Seq) Recent studies have revealed that the mRNA translation is punctuated by ribosomal pauses through the body of transcripts.      However, little is known about its physiological significance and regulatory aspects.      Here we present a multi-dimensional ribosome profiling approach to quantify the dynamics of initiation and elongation of 80S ribosomes across the entire transcriptome in mammalian cells.      We show that a subset of transcripts have a significant pausing of 80S ribosome around the start codon, creating a major barrier to the commitment of translation elongation.      Intriguingly, genes encoding ribosome proteins themselves exhibit an exceptionally high initiation pausing on their transcripts.      Our studies also reveal that the initiation pausing is dependent on the 5’ untranslated region (5’ UTR) of mRNAs and subject to the regulation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1).  Thus, the initiation pausing of 80S ribosome represents a novel regulatory step in translational control mediated by nutrient signaling pathway.     Monitor the translational status of transcriptome in mammalian cells under different conditions
 E-GEOD-75981 - microRNA-222 regulates muscle alternative splicing through Rbm24 during differentiation of skeletal muscle cells A number of microRNAs have been shown to regulate skeletal muscle development and differentiation.     MicroRNA-222 is downregulated during myogenic differentiation and its overexpression leads to alteration of muscle differentiation process and specialized structures.     By using RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) pulldown followed by RNA sequencing, combined with in silico microRNA target prediction, we have identified two new targets of microRNA-222 involved in the regulation of myogenic differentiation, Ahnak and Rbm24. Specifically, the RNA binding protein Rbm24 is a major regulator of muscle specific alternative splicing and its downregulation by microRNA-222 results in defective exon inclusion impairing the production of muscle-specific isoforms of Coro6, Fxr1 and NACA transcripts.     Reconstitution of normal levels of Rbm24 in cells overexpressing microRNA-222 rescues muscle-specific splicing.     In conclusion, we have identified a new function of microRNA-222 leading to alteration of myogenic differentiation at the level of alternative splicing, and we provide evidence that this effect is mediated by Rbm24 protein.     We built linear models using 2 different experiments and two conditions (miR222 over expression (n=1) and control siRNA(n=2)) with the linear formula (~condition + experiment).
 E-GEOD-52741 - Tet and TDG Mediate DNA Demethylation Essential for MET in Somatic Cell Reprogramming Tet-mediated DNA oxidation is a new type of epigenetic modification in mammals and its role in the regulation of cell fate transition remains poorly understood.     Here, we derive mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deleted in all three Tet genes and examine their capability to be reprogrammed into iPS cells.     We demonstrate that these Tet-deficient MEFs cannot be reprogrammed due to a blockage in the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). Reprogramming of MEFs deficient in TDG is similarly blocked.     The blockage is caused by impaired activation of crucial microRNAs, which depends on oxidative demethylation promoted by Tet and TDG. Reintroduction of either miR-200c or catalytically active Tet and TDG restores reprogramming to the respective knockout MEFs. Thus, oxidative demethylation is essential for somatic cell reprogramming.     These findings provide mechanistic insights into the operation of epigenetic barriers in cell lineage conversion.     Reduced Representation Bisulfite (RRBS, MspI,~75-400bp size fraction) and Tet-Assisted RRBS (TARRBS) of MEFs & reprogramming MEFs at Day 5
 E-GEOD-75631 - Distinct activities of Myf5 and MyoD indicate sequential roles in skeletal muscle lineage specification and differentiation (RNA-Seq) In this work we compare the molecular functions of Myf5 and MyoD, two highly related bHLH transcription factors that regulate skeletal muscle specification and differentiation.     We find MyoD and Myf5 bind the same sites genome-wide but have distinct functions: Myf5 induces histone acetylation without Pol II recruitment or robust gene activation, whereas MyoD induces histone acetylation, recruits PolII and robustly activates gene transcription.     RNA-Seq profiling of MyoD and Myf5
 E-GEOD-82005 - NFIB is a driver of SCLC initiation, progression and metastasis in mouse and marks metastatic disease in patients Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive type of lung cancer with early metastatic dissemination and invariable development of resistant disease for which no effective treatment is available to date.     Mouse models of SCLC based on inactivation of Rb1 and Trp53 developed earlier showed frequent amplifications of two transcription factor genes: Nfib and Mycl.     Overexpression of Nfib but not Mycl in SCLC mouse results in an enhanced and altered metastatic profile, and appears to be associated with genomic instability.     NFIB promotes tumor heterogeneity with the concomitant expansive growth of poorly differentiated, highly proliferative, and invasive tumor cell populations.     Consistent with the mouse data, NFIB expression in high-grade human neuroendocrine carcinomas correlates with advanced stage III/IV disease warranting its further assessment as a potentially valuable progression marker in a clinical setting.     Genomic DNA from mouse small cell lung tumor samples was analyzed by mate pair sequencing and low coverage sequencing.     And RNA from Nfib overexpressing mouse small cell lung cancer cell lines was further analyzed for high quality RNA profiles using Illumina Hiseq2500.  This series contains only RNA-seq data.
 E-GEOD-35087 - MacroH2A1 regulates the balance between self-renewal and differentiation commitment in embryonic and adult stem cells One of the most striking epigenetic alterations that occurs at the level of the nucleosome is the complete exchange of the canonical H2A histones for the macroH2A variant.     Here, we provide insight in the function of this unique histone variant in embryonic and adult stem cells.     Knockdown of macroH2A1 in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells limited their capacity to differentiate but not their self-renewal.     The loss of macroH2A1 interfered with the proper activation of differentiation genes, most of which are direct target genes of macroH2A. Additionally, macroH2A1-deficient mES cells displayed incomplete inactivation of pluripotency genes and formed defective embryoid bodies.     In vivo, macroH2A1-deficient teratomas contained a massive expansion of malignant, undifferentiated carcinoma tissue.     In the heterogeneous culture of primary human keratinocytes, macroH2A1 levels negatively correlated with the self-renewal capacity of the pluripotent compartment.     Together these results establish macroH2A1 as a critical chromatin component that regulates the delicate balance between self-renewal and differentiation of embryonic and adult stem cells.     Examination of the histone variant macroH2A1 in mouse Embryonic stem cells
 E-MTAB-2686 - The RelA T505A mouse reveals important NF-kappaB regulatory pathways controlling cell proliferation, apoptosis and lymphomagenesis Phosphorylation of the RelA(p65) Thr505 residue by Chk1 provides a mechanism of crosstalk between NF-kappaB signalling and DNA replication stress but its physiological significance was not known.     Therefore, to learn more about the role of this pathway in vivo, we generated a knockin mouse with a RelA T505A mutation.     Unlike RelA knockout mice, the RelA T505A mice develop normally but exhibit a variety of aberrant responses to stress.     Following partial hepatectomy, livers from RelA T505A mice proliferate more rapidly.     Moreover, in the Emu-Myc B-cell lymphoma model, tumorigenesis is more rapid and mice succumb to disease at significantly earlier times.     Analysis of embryonic fibroblasts from RelA T505A mice challenged with a range of DNA damaging agents revealed loss of pro-apoptotic RelA functions, at least in part due to DUSP1 dependent regulation of p38 MAP kinase activity.     This data reveals a critical pathway controlling NF-kappaB function that acts to suppress tumour-promoting activities of RelA.
 E-GEOD-49538 - Characterization of the Imprinting Signature of Mouse Embryo Fibroblasts by RNA Deep Sequencing Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) closely resemble mouse embryos and are convenient sources for biochemical studies when cell number may be limiting from mouse embryos.     To derive the imprinting signature of MEFs and potentially detect novel imprinted genes we characterized them using strand- and allele-specific RNA deep sequencing.     We used Sequenom allelotyping in embryo and adult organs to verify parental allele-specific expression patterns.     We found correct parental allele-specific transcription of 32 known ubiquitously imprinted genes in MEFs. Our analysis did not reveal any novel imprinted genes in MEFs, but detected extended parental allele-specific transcription in several known imprinted domains: maternal allele-specific transcription downstream of Grb10 and downstream of Meg3, Rtl1as and Rian in the Dlk1-Dio3 cluster, an imprinted domain implicated in development.     We detected paternal allele-specific transcription downstream of Nespas, Peg3, Peg12 and Snurf/Snrpn.     These imprinted transcript extensions were not unique to MEFs, but were also present in other somatic cells.     Their 5’ end points did not carry opposing chromatin marks or parental allele-specific DNA methylation, suggesting that their parental allele-specific transcription is under the control of the extended genes.     Based on the imprinting signature of MEFs, they provide valid models for understanding the biochemical aspects of genomic imprinting.     Strand-specific and parental allele-specific RNA-seq was done in female mouse embryo fibroblasts.
 E-GEOD-72272 - Study of RFX1 and RFX3 binding sites in the mouse genome The aim of the study was to identify RFX1 and RFX2 binding sites in mouse pancreatic beta cells.     Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with the mouse MIN6 beta cell line and antibodies raised against RFX1 and RFX3. Immunoprecipitated DNA was sequenced using the Genome Analyzer II (Illumina). Antibodies were described in       Reith W,   Ucla C,   Barras E,   Gaud A,   Durand B,   Herrero-Sanchez C,   Kobr M,   Mach B    : RFX1, a transactivator of hepatitis B virus enhancer I, belongs to a novel family of homodimeric and heterodimeric DNA-binding proteins.

 E-GEOD-51816 - Genomic and Proteomic Analyses of Prdm5 Reveal Interactions with Insulator Binding Proteins in Embryonic Stem Cells (ChIP-seq) PRDM proteins belong to the SET domain protein family, which is involved in the regulation of gene expression.     Although few PRDM members possess histone methyltransferase activity, the molecular mechanisms by which the other members exert transcriptional regulation remain to be delineated.     In this study, we find that Prdm5 is highly expressed in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells and exploit this cellular system to characterize molecular functions of Prdm5. By combining proteomics and next-generation sequencing technologies, we identify Prdm5 interaction partners and genomic occupancy.     We demonstrate that although Prdm5 is dispensable for mES cell maintenance, it directly targets genomic regions involved in early embryonic development and affects the expression of a subset of developmental regulators during cell differentiation.     Importantly, Prdm5 interacts with Ctcf, cohesin, and TFIIIC and cooccupies genomic loci.     In summary, our data indicate how Prdm5 modulates transcription by interacting with factors involved in genome organization in mouse embryonic stem cells.     ChIP-Sequencing of fragments enriched by immunoprecipitation of Prdm5 in wild type mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) in duplicate.     Background noise details obtained by ChIP-Sequencing of Prdm5 lacz/lacz MEF, in duplicate.
 E-GEOD-47892 - Maintenance of DNA methylation in embryonic stem cells depends on the histone H3K9 methyltransferases (K9 KO 5hmC-capture-seq) During mammalian development DNA methylation patterns need to be reset in primordial germ cells (PGC) and preimplantation embryos.

 E-GEOD-64359 - Quantitative analysis of chromatin interactions upon copy number variation at mouse 4E2 [RNA-seq] The three-dimensional organization of chromatin has a critical impact on the regulation of gene expression.     However, little is known about the effect of DNA copy number variants (CNVs) on chromatin organization.     We performed an allele-specific chromatin conformation and gene expression analysis of wild-type (WT) mouse chromosome 4 and an engineered 4.3Mb chromosome 4 deletion in mouse embryonic fibroblasts.     A newly developed quantitative framework for the analysis of paired-end 4C-seq data revealed a number of significant differentially interacting regions (DIRs) and higher-order chromatin compaction changes present in the deletion chromosome.     Selected DIRs were validated by 3D DNA FISH experiments.     We discovered a significant enrichment of CTCF and Smc1 binding sites within DIRs, as well as differentially expressed genes determined by RNA-Seq. Together, our findings highlight the complex effects of a 4E2 CNV on chromatin structure and function, both locally in the deletion chromosome and globally in the WT copy.     Examination of chromatin contacts and gene expression in wild type chromosome 4 and a 4.3Mb deletion in chromosome 4 in mouse
 E-GEOD-44760 - Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing in DNA methylation deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts DNA methylation and the Polycomb Repression System are epigenetic mechanisms that play important roles in maintaining transcriptional repression.     Recent evidence suggests that DNA methylation can attenuate the binding of Polycomb protein components to chromatin and thus plays a role in determining their genomic targeting.     However, whether this role of DNA methylation is important in the context of transcriptional regulation is unclear.     By genome-wide mapping of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-signature histone mark, H3K27me3, in severely DNA hypomethylated mouse somatic cells, we show that hypomethylation leads to widespread H3K27me3 redistribution, in a manner that reflects the local DNA methylation status in wild-type cells.     Unexpectedly, we observe striking loss of H3K27me3 and PRC2 from Polycomb-target gene promoters in DNA hypomethylated cells, including Hox gene clusters.     Importantly, we show that many of these genes become ectopically expressed in DNA hypomethylated cells, consistent with loss of Polycomb-mediated repression.     An intact DNA methylome is required for appropriate Polycomb-mediated gene repression by constraining PRC2 targeting.     These observations identify a previously unappreciated role for DNA methylation in gene regulation and therefore influence our understanding of how this epigenetic mechanism contributes to normal development and disease.     comparison of Dnmt1+/+ vs Dnmt1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts by Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing
 E-GEOD-65730 - Comprehensive role of Zfp217 in m6A methylation [ChIP-seq] Many transcriptional and epigenetic networks must be integrated to maintain self-renewal and pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and to enable induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming.      Here, we explore the role of Zfp217 as a key transcriptional factor in maintaining ES cell self-renewal by permorming genome-wide ChIP-Seq analyses.

Lysates split into two parts: one part serveed as the total RNA, the other part served as Cyt c-IP fraction.      Small RNAs were enriched from both parts and went through deep sequencing followed by bioinformatic analysis.

RNA-seq was used to measure gene expression levels in luciferase control and Zfp217 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) infected mouse stem cells
 E-GEOD-69237 - Astrocytes are reprogrammed into iPS cells through a neural stem cell-like state It remains controversial whether the routes from differentiated cells to iPSCs are related to the reverse order of normal developmental processes or independent of them.     Here, we generated iPSCs from mouse astrocytes by three (Oct3/4, Klf4 and Sox2 (OKS)), two (OK), or four (OKS plus c-Myc) factors.     Sox1, a neural stem cell (NSC)-specific transcription factor, is transiently upregulated during reprogramming and Sox1-positive cells become iPSCs. The upregulation of Sox1 is essential for OK-induced reprogramming.     Genome-wide analysis revealed that the gene expression profile of Sox1-expressing intermediate-state cells resembles that of NSCs. Furthermore, the intermediate-state cells are able to generate neurospheres, which can differentiate into both neurons and glial cells.     Remarkably, during MEF reprogramming, neither Sox1 upregulation nor an increase in neurogenic potential occurs.     Thus, astrocytes are reprogrammed through an NSC-like state, suggesting that reprogramming partially follows the retrograde pathway of normal developmental processes.     To investigate the gene expression profile of intermediate-state cells during astrocyte reprogramming, we performed genome-wide gene expression analysis in  five samples; starting astrocytes, intermediate-state cells expressing Sox1-GFP, NSCs, iPSCs established from astrocytes, and iPSCs established from MEFs (iPS-MEF-Ng-20D-17) that had previously been reported (Okita, K. et al. Nature 448: 313-317 (2007)). Two (NSCs, iPSCs from astrocytes and MEFs) or three (astrocytes, intermediate-state cells) biological replicates were prepared for microarray samples.     Total RNA was extracted with an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). cDNA synthesis and transcriptional amplification were performed using 50-100 ng of total RNA with the GeneChip WT PLUS Reagent Kit (Affymetrix). Fragmented and biotin-labeled cDNA targets were hybridized to GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST arrays (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.     Hybridized arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner.
 E-GEOD-17631 - Genome wide maps of histone demethylase jmjd3, chromatin state and RNA pol in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages Inflammatory responses triggered by either microbial or endogenous stimuli rely on a complex transcriptional program that involves the differential expression of hundreds of genes.     Jmjd3, a JmjC family histone demethylase (HDM), is quickly induced by the transcription factor NF-kB in response to inflammatory stimuli.     Jmjd3 erases a histone mark associated with transcriptional repression and silencing, trimethylated lysine 27 in histone H3 (H3K27me3). Thus, Jmjd3-mediated demethylation of H3K27me3 links inflammation to the control of a histone modification involved in lineage determination, differentiation and tissue homeostasis.     However, the specific contribution of Jmjd3 induction to innate immunity and inflammation remains unknown.     Here we combined genome-wide mapping and gene knockout studies to investigate this issue.     Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled to ultra high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) in LPS-stimulated primary mouse macrophages demonstrated that Jmid3 is recruited to a large number of genomic targets with a strong preference for active transcription start sites (TSS). Virtually all Jmjd3-bound TSSs were characterized by high levels of H3K4me3, a marker of gene activity, and high levels of RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Inducible genes showing a strong increase in H3K4me3 and Pol II recruitment after endotoxin treatment (including those encoding several cytokines, chemokines and antiviral proteins) were in most cases Jmjd3-associated.     In Jmjd3-knockout macrophages, initial RNA Pol II recruitment and activation of Jmjd3 target genes was unaffected, but RNA Pol II was prematurely released, thus resulting in non-sustained responses.     Importantly, most Jmjd3 target genes were not associated with detectable levels of H3K27me3, and transcriptional effects of Jmjd3 absence in the window of time analyzed here were uncoupled from measurable effects on this histone mark.     Our data indicate that Jmjd3 is the effector of an NF-kB-controlled feed-forward transcriptional loop pervasively sustaining inflammatory transcriptional responses in a manner that is independent of H3K27me3 demethylation, and suggest the possible use of anti-Jmjd3 drugs to dampen pathologic inflammation.      Keywords: Epigenetics Genome wide maps of histone demethylase jmjd3, the histone marks H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, and RNA-Polymerase II induction in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages of two types: (a) untreated and (b) stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and interferon gamma to produce an inflammatory response.
 E-GEOD-49806 - Chromatin position effects assayed by thousands of reporters integrated in parallel (tet-Off TRIP pools) Reporter genes integrated into the genome are a powerful tool to reveal effects of regulatory elements and local chromatin context on gene expression.     However, so far such reporter assays have been of low throughput.     Here we describe a multiplexing approach for the parallel monitoring of transcriptional activity of thousands of randomly integrated reporters.     More than 27,000 distinct reporter integrations in mouse embryonic stem cells, obtained with two different promoters, show ~1,000-fold variation in expression levels.     Data analysis indicates that lamina-associated domains act as attenuators of transcription, likely by reducing access of transcription factors to binding sites.     Furthermore, chromatin compaction is predictive of reporter activity.     We also found evidence for cross-talk between neighboring genes, and estimate that enhancers can influence gene expression on average over ~20 kb. The multiplexed reporter assay is highly flexible in design and can be modified to query a wide range of aspects of gene regulation.     TRIP assay of tet-Off promotor; 4 experiments, each with 2 technical replicates.     Each experiment was induced at 4 different concentrations of doxycycline.
 E-GEOD-77656 - STAT5 paralog dose governs T cell effector and regulatory function The transcription factor STAT5 is fundamental to the mammalian immune system.     However, the relationship between its two paralogs, STAT5A and STAT5B, and the extent to which they are functionally distinct, remains controversial.     We addressed this longstanding question in primary CD4+ 'helper' T cells, the principal orchestrators of adaptive immunity.     Using a combination of genetic and genomic approaches, we demonstrate that, although both influence regulatory (Treg) and effector T cell responses, and control many of the same genes, they are not functionally equivalent and, in fact, only the latter is required for immunological tolerance.     Differences in genomic distribution and transcriptomic output support the conclusion that STAT5B is dominant and, surprisingly, point towards relative abundance (i.e. paralog dose), rather than unique functional capabilities, as the principal distinguishing feature.     Collectively, our data provide a unifying model for the discrete and redundant activities of STAT5A and STAT5B, establishing that asymmetrical expression underlies paralog specificity (or dominance) in the face of widespread structural homology.     This dataset includes 55 individual samples of transcriptome or STAT5 distibution data from cytokine treated CD4+T cells.     Each culture condition includes at least 2 biological replicates per genotype.
 E-GEOD-16526 - Genome-wide map of PCL2 (Polycomb-like 2) enrichment in undifferentiated mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) In total 8,736,191 reads from IP fraction and 9,958,984 reads from Wash fraction uniquely mapped to the mouse genome (mm9). Settings for enrichment analysis: maxSpacing=500; minHits=20; minPeakHits=6; minRatio=3. 4,701 regions have been identified as enriched in the IP fraction.     In order to get a rough idea of false discovery rate (FDR), enrichment analysis using Wash fraction as test and IP fraction as control was performed, 15 regions was found.     This suggests that the FDR likely is around 0.3%.  Keywords: Epigenetics Examination of PCL2 enrichment in mouse ESCs.
 E-GEOD-48649 - High-resolution chromosomal maps of Xist RNA reveal a two-step spreading mechanism during X-inactivation The Xist long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is essential for X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), the process by which mammals compensate for unequal numbers of sex chromosomes.     During XCI, Xist coats the future inactive X (Xi) and recruits Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) to the X-inactivation center (Xic). Currently unclear is how Xist spreads silencing on a 150 Mb scale.     Here we generate high-resolution maps of Xist binding across a developmental time course using CHART-seq.     In female cells undergoing XCI de novo, Xist follows a two-step mechanism in which it initially targets gene-rich islands before spreading to intervening gene-poor domains.     Xist is depleted from genes that escape XCI but frequently concentrates near escapee boundaries.     Xist binding was linearly proportional to PRC2 density and H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), suggesting co-migration of Xist and PRC2. Interestingly, when the Xi is acutely stripped of Xist in post-XCI cells, Xist recovers quickly within both gene-rich and -poor domains on a time scale of hours instead of days, suggesting a previously primed Xi chromatin state.     We conclude that Xist spreading takes on distinct stage-specific forms: During initial establishment, Xist follows a two-step mechanism, but during maintenance, Xist spreads rapidly to both gene-rich and -poor regions.     Capture hybridization analysis of RNA targets (CHART) and input samples of (differentiating) mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) using paired-end 75 nt reads on Illumina HiSeq2500, with 2 replicates per sample (# of samples).

 E-GEOD-22341 - CHD7 targets active gene enhancer elements to modulate ES cell-specific gene expression. Gene expression changes were measured between mouse ES cells of three genotypes: WT Chd7, Heterzygous Chd7 Null, Homozygous Chd7 Null.      The hypothesis being tested was that CHD7, a chromatin remodeling protein, functions as a transcriptional regulator.      This experiment was performed to detect gene targets of CHD7-mediated regulation.      We report the genome-wide binding profile of CHD7, the protein implicated in CHARGE syndrome, in mouse ES cells using ChIP-Seq technology.     Combining these data with other genomic datasets, we discover CHD7 to colocalize with other transcription factors including Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, and p300 at gene enhancer elements to regulate ES cell specific gene expression.     Chd7 wildtype, heterozygous, and homozygous ES cells derived from preimplantation embryos were grown on feeder cells and total RNA was isolated using Trizol.     The ratio of ES to feeder cells was estimated at 5:1.  ChIP sequencing of CHD7 and p300 in mouse ES cells

To find the downstream target genes of vitamin C and investigate the mechanism of vitamin C on reprogramming promotion, we performed Microarray analyses to identify its downstream targets.     Retinoic acid (RA), a stimulus molecule for cellular differentiation, is set as negative control.     The data show the genes regulated by vitamin C or RA. J1 mESCs maintained in medium containing 1000 U/mL LIF and supplemented without or with vitamin C or RA for 24 hours, then total RNA was extracted for analysis.

 E-GEOD-45284 - Transcription profiling by high throughput sequencing of murine neural stem/progenitor cells lacking PRMT5 over control Protein Arginine MethylTransferase 5 (PRMT5) is known to mediate epigenetic control on chromatin and to functionally regulate components of the splicing machinery.     In this study we show that selective deletion of PRMT5 in different organs leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.     At the molecular level, PRMT5 depletion results in reduced methylation of Sm proteins, aberrant constitutive splicing and in the Alternative Splicing (AS) of specific mRNAs. We identify Mdm4 as one of these mRNAs, which due to its weak 5’-Donor site, acts as a sensor of splicing defects and transduces the signal to activate the p53 response, providing a mechanistic explanation of the phenotype observed in PRMT5 conditional knockout mice.     Our data demonstrate a key role of PRMT5, together with p53, as guardians of the transcriptome.     This will have fundamental implications in our understanding of PRMT5 activity, both in physiological conditions, as well as pathological conditions, including cancer and neurological diseases.     Total RNA was extracted from control and Prmt5 depleted Neural Stem/Progenitors Cells (NPCs) and Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs). Prmt5 depleted cells were treated with 4-OHT 24 hours before splitting to induce PRMT5 knockout and final libraries were sequenced in triplicates on Illumina HiSeq 2000.
 E-GEOD-43318 - Gene expression changes in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF cells) deficient for Ing1 and Gadd45a ING1b and GADD45a are nuclear proteins involved in the regulation of cell growth, apoptosis and DNA repair.     We found that ING1b and GADD45a physically and functionally interact in the epigenetic regulation of specific target genes.     In order to study this interaction further, we analysed the transcriptional changes in MEF cells from single and double Ing1/Gadd45 knockout mice via microarray profiling.     Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF cells) were isolated from embryonic day E15.5 male embryos, either wild-type (WT) or knockout for Ing1 (Ing1-/-), Gadd45a (Gadd45a-/-) or Ing1/Gadd45a (double knockout, DKO), and cultured for 3 passages.     Samples were then collected in duplicates per MEF line for expression array profiling.
 E-GEOD-65748 - Genome-wide binding and mechanistic analyses of Smchd1 mediated epigenetic regulation [ChIP-Seq, MBD-Seq] Purpose: The aim of this study is (1) to identify the chromatin occupancy of the epigenetic regulator Smchd1 in neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from E14.5 mouse brain; (2) to profile key epigenetic marks H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and DNA methylation in wild type and Smchd1 null NSCs; (3) to identify the chromatin occupancy of Ctcf in wild type and Smchd1 null NSCs. Methods: Chromatin immunoprecipitation for Smchd1, H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and Ctcf was performed essentially as in (Nelson et al. 2006). Briefly, nuclei were isolated from formaldehyde crosslinked NSCs and chromatin was fragmented by sonication.     Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed with corresponding antibodies for Smchd1, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3. DNA was extracted from the immunoprecipitated fraction following reverse-crosslinking.     Isolated DNA was used to generate sequencing libraries with Illumina's TruSeq DNA Sample Preparation Kit or Ovation Ultralow system (NuGen) according to manufacturer's instruction.     Libraries were pooled and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform for 100 bp single-end reads.     Image analysis was performed in real time by the HiSeq Control Software (HCS) v1.4.8 and Real Time Analysis (RTA) v1.12.4.2, running on the instrument computer.     Real-time base calling on the HiSeq instrument computer was performed with the RTA software.     Illumina CASAVA1.8 pipeline was used to generate the sequence data.     To examine the level of DNA methylation, genomic DNA was extracted using an AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) and methylated DNA was isolated via binding to the methyl-CpG binding domain of human MBD2 protein coupled beads using the MethylMiner methylated DNA enrichment kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.     Isolated DNA was used to generate sequencing libraries as for the ChIP-seq experiment with Illumina’s TruSeq DNA Sample Preparation Kit according to manufacturer's instruction and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform for 49 bp single-end reads.     Sequencing analysis was performed as described for the ChIP-seq experiments.     Chromatin occupancy of the epigenetic regulator Smchd1 in neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from E14.5 mouse brain was determined by Smchd1 ChIP-seq.     Enrichment of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in wild type and Smchd1 null NSCs were assessed by H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq, respectively.      DNA methylation in wild type and Smchd1 null NSCs was assessed by MBD-seq.     Chromatin occupancy of Ctcf in wild type and Smchd1 null NSCs was determined by by Ctcf ChIP-seq.
 E-GEOD-57698 - RNA-seq of mouse ES cells depleted of MOF, MSL1, MSL2 or KANSL3 We have studied the regulatory potential of MYST1-(MOF)-containing MSL and NSL complexes in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and neuronal progenitors.     We find that both complexes influence transcription by binding to promoters as well as TSS-distal enhancer regions.     In contrast to flies, the MSL complex is not enriched on the X chromosome yet it is crucial for mammalian X chromosome regulation as it specifically regulates Tsix ncRNA, the major repressor of Xist lncRNA. MSL depletion leads to severely decreased Tsix expression, reduced REX1 recruitment, and consequently accumulation of Xist RNA in ESCs. The NSL complex provides additional, Tsix-independent repression of Xist by maintaining pluripotency.     MSL and NSL complexes therefore act synergistically by using distinct pathways to ensure a fail-safe mechanism for the repression of X inactivation in ESCs. We have performed ChIP-seq of KANSL3, MCRS1, MOF, MSL1 and MSL2 in mouse ESCs, and KANSL3, MOF and MSL2 in NPCs, in duplicate and normalised against their inputs.     We have also performed RNA-seq following knockdown of Kansl3, Mof, Msl1 and Msl2 mouse embryonic stem cells in triplicate.     NB: Kansl3 and Mof knockdown-RNAseq are analyzed against their own scrambled controls, and Msl1 and Msl2 against another scrambled control triplicate.
 E-GEOD-62151 - Upstream Anti-sense Promoters Act as Local Enhancers of Mammalian Protein-coding Genes Anti-sense transcription originating upstream of mammalian protein-coding genes is a well-documented phenomenon, but remarkably little is known about the function or regulation of these anti-sense promoters or the non-coding RNAs they generate.     Here we define at nucleotide resolution the divergent transcription start sites (TSSs) near mouse mRNAs. We find that coupled sense and anti-sense TSSs form the boundaries of an evolutionarily conserved and nucleosome-depleted regulatory region with dramatically enriched transcription factor (TF) occupancy.     Notably, as the distance between sense and anti-sense TSSs increases, so does the level of TF binding and signal-dependent gene activation.     We further discover a cluster of anti-sense TSSs in macrophages with an enhancer-like chromatin signature.     Remarkably, this signature identifies promoters that are selectively and rapidly activated during immune challenge.     We conclude that anti-sense TSSs can serve as potent, local enhancers of sense-strand gene expression by facilitating TF binding and deposition of activating histone modifications.     ChIP-seq, Start-RNA-seq, and MNase-seq from mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), and Start-RNA-seq from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) are included.     For ChIP-seq, two biological replicates are included for each of three treatment conditions; untreated, 30 minutes lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and 2 hours LPS. Each biological replicate for all ChIP conditions was sequenced in two lanes for depth, creating two technical replicates for each biological replicate.     Raw files for paired technical replicates are labeled as repX.1 and repX.2, where repX.1 is technical replicate 1 and repX.2 is technical replicate 2. For Start-RNA-seq in BMDMs, two biological replicates are included for each of three treatment conditions; untreated, 30 min LPS, and 2 hr LPS. For MNase-seq, data from three biological replicates of untreated BMDMs are included.     Four technical replicates of biological replicate 1, two technical replicates of biological replicate 2, and four technical replicates of biological replicate 3 are included.     Raw files for paired technical replicates are labeled as repX.1, repX.2, repX.3, etc.     For Start-RNA-seq in untreated MEFs, two biological replicates are included.     Two technical replicates for each of the MEF Start-RNA-seq biological replicates are included.     Paired technical replicates are labeled as repX.1 and repX.2.

 E-GEOD-48206 - Gene Expression Profile for knocking down Tet1 in pre-iPSCs culturing in Vc medium. Tet1 is a hydroxylase known for its role in the conversion of 5-methylcytosines (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC) involved in the possible active demethylation process and gene expression regulation.     As somatic cell reprogramming involves the re-activation of pluripotency genes and the silencing of somatic ones, it remains unclear the role of Tet1 in the reprogramming process.     Here, we performed RNAseq for WT and knocking down Tet1 in two pre-iPSCs cell lines, pre2-2 and pre3. Using two pre-iPSCs cell lines: pre2-2 and pre3, cultured by mES medium(+lif), transfected siCtrl/siTet1 siRNA or non-treatment, then, after 16h, the medium were replaced by mES(+lif) medium plus Vc(50ug/ml), total RNA was extracted after another 32h later for RNAseq.
 E-GEOD-17664 - Conversion of Epiblast Stem Cells to Embryonic Stem Cells by Small Molecules Recently, (in vitro) pluripotent EpiSCs were derived from the post-implantation egg cylinder stage epiblasts of mouse and rat.     These EpiSCs resemble and correspond very closely to the conventional human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in the colony morphology and culture/signaling requirements for maintaining pluripotency, but exhibit a range of significant phenotypic and signaling response differences from the conventional mouse ES cells (mESCs). These observations strongly support the notion that EpiSCs and hESCs are intrinsically similar, and raise an attractive hypothesis: as mESCs and EpiSCs/hESCs represent two distinct pluripotency states: the mESC-like state representing the ICM of pre-implantation blastcyst and the EpiSC-like state representing the post-implantation epiblasts, whether the epiblast state (including conventional hESCs) can be converted back to the ICM state.       Despite  studies providing evidence that epiblast-like cells exist and transition back and forth within colony of conventional mESCs; mESCs and EpiSCs share substantial set of pluripotency transcriptional factors, including Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog; and mESCs are more stable in culture, in the present study we found that EpiSCs differentiated rapidly  under mESC culture conditions and no “spontaneously” converted mESC could be readily identified and isolated over serial passages at the population or clonal level.     Remarkably, we found that blockage of the TGFβ pathway or inhibition of the H3K4 demethylase LSD1 with small molecule inhibitors induced dramatic morphological changes of EpiSCs towards mESC phenotypes with activation of some ICM-specific gene expression.     However, full conversion of EpiSCs to a mESC-like state with competence to chimeric contribution can only be readily generated with a combination of inhibitors of LSD1 and ALK. These observations underscore a powerful and direct induction of reprogramming from the developmentally later-stage EpiSCs to a mESC-like stage by a synergy of signaling and direct epigenetic modulations.     It also highlights a significant role for TGFβ pathway inhibition in promoting reprogramming to and sustaining true pluripotency, which further supports our recent studies in generating chimerism-competent rat pluripotent cells.     Collectively, our studies provide a proof-of-concept demonstration that pluripotency-restricted EpiSCs can be readily converted to a mESC-like state in the absence of any genetic manipulation by precise pharmacological control of signaling pathways that distinguish the two pluripotency states and an epigenetic target simultaneously, and offer a convenient experimental system to further study the mechanism.     Such method and concept may also provide an avenue for generating a new type of mESC-like human pluripotent cell.     Global gene-expression analyses of the parnate/mAMFGi cells
 E-GEOD-72941 - RNA-seq analysis reveals profound changes in transcript profiles between siCon- and siH19-transfected myotubes We used high throughput sequencing to analyze the transcriptional profiling of myotubes.     By comparing the transcriptional profiling of myotubes with or without H19 knockdown,1131 genes or transcripts were found at least 1.5-fold up-regulated in siH19 relative to siCon cells, meanwhile 508 genes or transcripts were found at least 1.5-fold down-regulated in siH19 over siCon cells.     40h following initiation of differentiation, myotubes were transfected with either control siRNA or siH19. 48h later after transfection, total RNA was extracted for library preparation and RNA-seq analysis to compare trancript profiles between siCon and siH19 cells.
 E-GEOD-23216 - PITX1 suppresses TERT transcription Using microcell-mediated chromosome transfer (MMCT) into the mouse melanoma cell line, B16F10, we have previously found that human chromosome 5 carries a gene, or genes, that can negatively regulate TERT expression.     To identify the gene responsible for the regulation of TERT transcription, we performed cDNA microarray analysis using parental B16F10 cells, telomerase negative B16F10 microcell hybrids with a human chromosome 5 (B16F10MH5), and its revertant clones (MH5R) with reactivated telomerase.     Here we report the identification of PITX1, whose restoration  leads to the downregulation of mouse tert (mtert) transcription, as a TERT suppressor gene.     Additionally, both human TERT (hTERT) and mouse TERT (mtert) promoter activity can be suppressed by PITX1. We showed that three and one binding sites, respectively, within the hTERT and mtert promoters that express a unique conserved region are responsible for the transcriptional activation of TERT. Furthermore, we showed that PITX1 binds to the TERT promoter both in vitro and in vivo.     Thus, PITX1 suppresses TERT transcription through direct binding to the TERT promoter, which ultimately regulates telomerase activity.     We transferred intact human chromosome 5 into mouse melanoma B16F10 cells by microcell fusion.     The microcell hybrids (MH5) exhibited suppression of telomerase, we also obtained revertant clones (MH5R) in which telomerase is reactivated.     To identify the differentially expressed genes on human chromosome 5, we performed expression microarray analysis using these two clones and parental B16F10 cells.
 E-GEOD-61523 - Epigenetic targeting of activation-induced cytidine deaminase Precisely how AID is recruited to these off-target sites is not entirely understood.     To gain further insight into how AID selects its targets we compared AID-mediated translocations in two different cell types, B cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). AID targets a distinct set of hotspots in the two cell types.     In both cases, hotspots are concentrated in highly transcribed but stalled genes.     However, transcription alone is insufficient to recruit AID activity.     Comparison of genes similarly transcribed in B cells and MEFs but targeted in only one of the two cell types reveals a common set of epigenetic features associated with AID recruitment in both cell types.     AID target genes are enriched in chromatin modifications associated with active enhancers (such as H3K27Ac) and marks of active transcription (such as H3K36me3) in both fibroblasts and B cells, indicating that these features are universal mediators of AID recruitmen Analysis of total mRNA and PolII loading in activated B lymphocytes and Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs)

 E-GEOD-20503 - Stromal factors SDF1alpha, sFRP1 and VEGFD induce dopaminergic neuron differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells The identified stromal factors SDF1alpha, sFRP1 and VEGFD induce dopaminergic neuron differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells.     Human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived dopaminergic (DA) neurons are potentially useful for treating Parkinson’s disease (PD) through cell replacement therapy.      Generation of DA neurons from hESCs has been achieved by co-culture with the stromal cell line PA6, a source of stromal cell-derived inducing activity (SDIA).  However, the factor(s) produced by stromal cells that constitute SDIA is unknown.      We previously reported that medium conditioned by PA6 cells can generate functional DA neurons in the human embryonal carcinoma stem cell line, NTera2.  Here we further examined the effects of PA6-conditioned medium and found that it can induce DA neuronal differentiation in both the NTera2 cell line and the hESC line, I6.  To identify the factor(s) responsible for SDIA, we used large-scale microarray analysis of gene expression combined with proteomic analysis of PA6-conditioned medium.      Four candidate factors (hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), stromal cell-derived factor-1 alpha (SDF1alpha), secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (sFRP1) and vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGFD)) were identified and immunoaffinity capillary electrophoresis (ICE) was used to establish the protein concentration of these factors in conditioned medium.      Upon addition of SDF1alpha, sFRP1, and VEGFD, we observed an increase in the number of tyrosine hydroxylase- and TuJ1- positive cells in both the NTera2 and I6 cell lines.      These results indicate that SDF1alpha, sFRP1 and VEGF-D are major components of SDIA, and suggest the potential use of these defined factors to elicit dopaminergic differentiation of pluripotent stem cells as a therapeutic intervention in PD. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were grown in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS; this conditioned media was used as the control.      PA6, mouse stromal cells, were grown in MEM-alpha supplemented with 10% FBS; this conditioned media is known to induce differentiation in hES cells.

 E-GEOD-42306 - H2A.X native ChIP-Seq in ESC and iPSC: Histone Variant H2A.X Mediated Epigenetic Mechanisms are Critical for Maintaining Genome Stability and Pluripotency in ES and iPS Cells It is well-known that embryonic stem cells (ESC) are much more sensitive to replication-induced stress than differentiated cells but the underpinning mechanisms are largely unknown.     H2A.X, a minor variant of H2A, constitutes only 1-10% of the mammalian genome.      H2A.X plays a well-known for role in the DNA damage response and maintaining stability in the genome, including the regions frequently experiencing replication stress, such as the fragile sites.     Intriguingly, several recent studies have reported that H2A.X function is elevated in ESC; and others reported that H2A.X function is provoked during cellular reprogramming (in induced pluripotent stem cells, iPSC), indicating that increased proliferation during iPS may trigger replication stress and the H2A.X DNA damage response.      However, several studies of genomic instability in iPSC led to different conclusions on this important issue.     For example, frequent copy number variants (CNV) were reported at the genomic regions sensitive to replication stress, such as the fragile sites.     On the other hand, another study reported the lack of genomic instability in mouse iPS clones that are able to generate “all-iPS” animals in tetraploid complementation assays (4N+ iPSC), indicative of a potential link between pluripotency and genome integrity.     However, whether if high level genomic instability occurs in the 4N- iPSC iPSC clones at replication stress sensitive regions is unknown.      Moreover, due to the lack of mechanistic insights on genome integrity maintenance, how pluripotency and genome integrity are connected remains elusive.     Here we show that H2A.X plays unexpected roles in maintaining pluripotency and genome integrity in ESC and iPSC. In ESC, it is specially enriched at genomic regions sensitive to replication stress so that it protects genome integrity thereat.     Faithful H2A.X deposition is critical for genome integrity and pluripotency in iPSC. H2A.X depositions in 4N+ iPSC clones faithfully recapitulate the ESC pattern and therefore, prevent genome instability.     On the other hand, insufficient H2A.X depositions in 4N- iPSC clones at such regions lead to genome instability and defects in replication stress response and DNA repair, reminiscent of the H2A.X deficient ESC. Detect and compare different H2A.X deposition patterns in ES cells and iPS cells, with Illumina HiSeq 2000 and Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx
 E-GEOD-46918 - Xist exploits three-dimensional chromosome architecture to spread across the X-chromosome Many large noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate chromatin, but the mechanisms by which they localize to genomic targets remain unexplored.     Here we investigate the localization mechanisms of Xist during X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), a paradigm of lncRNA-mediated chromatin regulation.     During the maintenance of XCI, Xist binds broadly across the X-chromosome.      During initiation of XCI, Xist initially transfers to distal regions across the X-chromosome that are not defined by specific sequences.     Instead, Xist identifies these regions by exploiting the three-dimensional conformation of the X-chromosome.     Xist initially accumulates on the periphery of actively transcribed regions and requires its silencing domain to spread across active regions.     This suggests a model where Xist coats the entire X-chromosome by searching in three dimensions, modifying chromosome structure, and spreading to newly accessible locations.     We examined the genomic localization of the Xist lncRNA using RNA Antisense Purification (RAP) in multiple cell contexts: 1) differentiated female cells (MLFs);  2) a time-course of Xist localization in male embryonic stem (ES) cells where the endogenous Xist promoter is replaced by a tet-inducible one (pSM33); 3) a time-course of Xist localization in differentiating female ES cells (F1 2-1); and 4) wild-type (delXF6) and A-repeat deletion (delSXC9) Xist transgenes incorporated into the Hprt locus under the control of a tet-inducible promoter.
 E-GEOD-28021 - Identification of Tfeb-dependent genes downstream of mTORC1 in MEFs Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) is a critical regulator of cell growth by integrating multiple signals (nutrients, growth factors, energy and stress) and is frequently deregulated in many types of cancer.     We used a robust experimental paradigm involving the combination of two interventions, one genetic and one pharmacologic to identify genes regulated transcriptionally by mTORC1. In Tsc2+/+, but not Tsc2-/- immortalized mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), serum deprivation downregulates mTORC1 activity.     In Tsc2-/- cells, abnormal mTORC1 activity can be downregulated by treatment with rapamycin (sirolimus). By contrast, rapamycin has little effect on mTORC1 in Tsc2+/+ cells in which mTORC1 is already inhibited by low serum.     Thus, under serum deprived conditions, mTORC1 activity is low in Tsc2+/+ cells (untreated or rapamycin treated), high in Tsc2-/- cells, but lowered by rapamycin; a pattern referred to as a “low/low/high/low” or “LLHL”. We found that mTORC1 regulated the expression of, among other lysosomal genes, V-ATPases through the transcription factor EB (TFEB, Tcfeb in the mouse). The knockdown of Tfeb resulted in the 'flattening' of the LLHL pattern and allowed the identification of genes regulated by mTORC1 through Tfeb Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) wild type or deficient in Tsc2 expressing a Tfeb shRNA or scrambled shRNA vector were treated with 25 nM rapamycin or vehicle (methanol) for 24 h under low serum conditions (0.1% FBS)
 E-GEOD-23581 - Graded Nodal/Activin Signaling Governs ES Cell Fate Decisions via Differential Recruitment of Phospho-Smad2 to Oct4 and Distinct Target Gene Subsets. The Nodal/Activin morphogens are secreted signaling molecules that form concentration gradients during early embryogenesis providing stem cells with positional information and differentiation instructions important for embryonic patterning.     The molecular basis driving stem cell interpretation of signaling gradients and the undertaking of distinct cell fate decisions remains poorly understood.     We show that perturbation of endogenous Nodal/Activin signaling in ES cells leads to exit from self renewal towards mesendodermal differentiation at high signaling and trophectoderm induction during low signaling.     ChIP-seq of Phospho-Smad2, the downstream transcription factor of the Nodal/Activin pathway reveals binding to distinct subsets of target genes in a dose dependent manner including the promoter region of the Oct4 master regulator of stemness.     Consequently, both Oct4 mRNA and protein levels are directly driven by graded Nodal/Activin signaling.     Hence stem cells interpret and carry out differential Nodal/Activin signaling instructions via a corresponding gradient of Smad2 phosphorylation that selectively titers self renewal against alternative differentiation programs.     3 pSmad2 ChIP samples corresponding to ES cells pretreated for 6 hours in 10uM SB followed by 18 hours in 25ng/ml Activin, 1/5000 DMSO and 10uM SB in 20% KSR media.     Controls include the corresponding input DNA for each treatment.
 E-GEOD-39034 - Mammalian cells acquire epigenetic hallmarks of human cancer during immortalization Progression to malignancy requires cells to overcome senescence and switch to an immortal phenotype.     Thus, exploring the genetic and epigenetic changes that occur during senescence/immortalization may help elucidate crucial events that lead to cell transformation.     In the present study, we have globally profiled DNA methylation in relation to gene expression in primary, senescent and immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts.     Primary, senescent and immortalized mouse fibroblasts obtained from three independent embryos.     Compare immortalized versus primary and senescent versus primary cells.
 E-GEOD-74278 - Transposable elements and their KRAB-ZFP controllers regulate gene expression in adult tissues The tetrapod-restricted KRAB-containing zinc finger proteins (KRAB-ZFPs) are essential early embryonic controllers of transposable elements (TEs), which they repress via their cofactor KAP1 and associated effectors through histone and DNA methylation, a process thought to result in irreversible silencing.     Using a target-centered functional screen, we matched several murine TEs with their cognate KRAB-ZFP. This revealed an unexpected level of granularity in their interactions, with KRAB-ZFPs recognizing TEs from more than one subfamily, TEs recruiting more than one KRAB-ZFP, and spatially and temporally differential KRAB-ZFP-mediated regulation of TEs and nearby genes.     Most importantly, we discovered that the KRAB/KAP1 system controls TEs in adult tissues, in cell culture and in vivo, where they partner up to regulate the expression of cellular genes.     Therefore, TEs and KRAB-ZFPs establish widely active transcription networks that regulate not only development but probably also many physiological events.     Given the high degree of species-specificity of both TEs and KRAB-ZFPs, these results have important implications for studying and understanding the biology of higher vertebrates, including humans.

 E-GEOD-23539 - Identification of immediate early transcriptional targets of ephrin-B1 forward signaling The goal of this study was to identify immediate early transcriptional targets of ephrin-B1 forward signaling that are relevant to palatogenesis.     The Ephs compose a family of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling molecules that can be activated by their cognate ligands, the ephrins.      Despite the importance of Eph/ephrin signaling in a wide variety of developmental and cell biological processes, a potential downstream transcriptional response has not been explored.      To understand the role of ephrin-B1 signaling in palatogenesis, we examined transcriptional response to ephrin-B1 in a primary mouse embryonic palatal shelf cell culture system.      We find an immediate early signature of gene expression that reflects the activation of Erk/MAPK signaling by ephrin-B1 signaling in the palatal shelves.     Induction of primary palate cells with 2 ug/ml of pre-clustered ephrin-B1 for one hour.     Uninduced primary palate cells are the control.     Four replicates each.
 E-GEOD-65747 - Genome-wide binding and mechanistic analyses of Smchd1 mediated epigenetic regulation [RNA-Seq] Purpose: The aim of this study is to identify genes that are under the transcriptional control of the epigenetic regulator Smchd1 in neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from E14.5 mouse brain Methods: Total RNA was extracted using an AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) from cultured neural stem cells derived from male mouse E14.5 brains either wild-type or null for Smchd1. 1 µg total RNA was used to generate sequencing libraries for whole transcriptome analysis with Illumina’s TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit v2 as per standard protocols.     Libraries were sequenced on HiSeq 2000 with Illumina TruSeq SBS Kit v3-HS reagents as either 100 bp single-end or paired-end reads at the Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF), Melbourne.     Reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome mm10 and mapped to known genomic features at the gene level using the Rsubread package (version 1.10.5) (Liao et al. 2013). Mapped reads were then summarized into gene-level counts using FeatureCounts (Liao et al. 2014). Total RNA was extracted and purified from each cell line and their transcriptomes analyzed by RNA-Seq.
 E-GEOD-22182 - Global Deterministic and Stochastic Allelic Specific Gene Expression in Single Blastomeres of Mouse Early Embryos Here we modified a single cell whole transcriptome amplification method to make it capable of amplifying cDNAs as long as 3kb efficiently and unbiasedly.     We combined this modified single cell cDNA amplification method with Applied Biosystems next generation sequencing SOLiD™ System to set up a single cell whole transcriptome assay.      The modified amplification strategy allows us to amplify full-length cDNAs for most of the expressed genes.     We show that it is feasible to get digital gene expression profiles at single cell resolution.     This allows us to ask fundamental biological questions that could not be addressed previously and to understand transcriptome complexity at the resolution of a single cell.     Oocyte, Two-cell, Four-cell, and 8-cell stage embryos were recovered from MF1 females mated with MF1 male mice (Nagy et al. 2003). The zona pellucida was removed by treatment with acidic tyrode solution.     The individual blastomeres were separated by gentle pipeting using a glass capillary.     RNA-Seq from 24 single mouse blastomeres from oocytes, 2-cell, 4-cell and 8-cell stages.
 E-GEOD-26657 - ChIP-Seq data for histone marks in mouse embryonic fibroblasts The conversion of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) by forced expression of Oct4, Sox2 and Klf4 is among the earliest demonstrations of reprogramming to a pluripotent state by forced expression of transcription factors.     To gain insights into the chromatin state of genes required for reprogramming, we profiled H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and H3K9me3. DNA was enriched by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and analyzed by Solexa sequencing.     ChIP was performed using an antibody against H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and H3K9me3.
 E-GEOD-40948 - Genome-wide nucleosome positioning during embryonic stem cell development [RNA-Seq] We determined genome-wide nucleosome occupancy in mouse embryonic stem cells and their neural progenitor and embryonic fibroblast counterparts to assess features associated with nucleosome positioning during lineage commitment.     Cell type and protein specific binding preferences of transcription factors to sites with either low (e.g. Myc, Klf4, Zfx) or high (e.g. Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2) nucleosome occupancy as well as complex patterns for CTCF were identified.     Nucleosome depleted regions around transcription start and termination sites were broad and more pronounced for active genes, with distinct patterns for promoters classified according to their CpG-content or histone methylation marks.     Throughout the genome nucleosome occupancy was dependent on the presence of certain histone methylation or acetylation modifications.     In addition, the average nucleosome-repeat length increased during differentiation by 5-7 base pairs, with local variations for specific genomic regions.     Our results reveal regulatory mechanisms of cell differentiation acting through nucleosome repositioning.     The Total RNA from ESCs, NPCs and MEFs was extracted by guanidinisothiocyanat/phenol extraction with the Trifast kit (Peqlab). Total RNA preparations were treated with DNase I, phenol/chloroform extracted and precipitated before further processing.     RNAs were depleted of 5S, 5.8S, 18S and 28S rRNAs using the Human/Mouse/Rat Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (Epicentre) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.     After rRNA depletion, RNAs were fragmented with a kit from Ambion.     Libraries for Solexa sequencing were generated according to the standard Illumina protocol that comprised first strand cDNA synthesis, second strand cDNA synthesis, end repair, addition of a single A base, and adapter ligation.     Sequencing was performed on the  Illumina GAIIx (replicate 1) and Illumina HiSeq 2000 (replicate 2) platforms at the sequencing core facilities of the BioQuant in Heidelberg, Germany.     RNA reads were aligned with TopHat. Further expression analysis was with the Genomatix software suite (Genomatix, Munich, Germany) and the Eldorado gene annotation.     For each transcript a normalized expression value was calculated from the read distribution that accounts for the length differences using the program DEseq for the analysis of differential expression.
 E-GEOD-16439 - Response of gastric epithelial progenitors to H. pylori isolates from Swedish patients with chronic atrophic gastritis 2 Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with development of gastric adenocarcinoma in a subset of infected humans, especially those that develop an antecedent condition, chronic atrophic gastritis (ChAG) characterized by loss of acid-producing parietal cells.     Studies in a gnotobiotic transgenic mouse model of ChAG, with an engineered ablation of parietal cells and an associated expansion of gastric epithelial progenitors (GEPs), have shown that a subset of GEPs is able to harbor intracellular collections of H. pylori.      To better understand H. pylori’s adaptation to ChAG, we sequenced the genomes of 24 isolates, obtained from 6 individuals, each sampled over a 4-year interval, as they maintained normal gastric histology, or progressed from normal histology to ChAG, or experienced worsening ChAG, or proceeded from ChAG to cancer.     Analyses of gene content and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) demonstrated that H. pylori populations within study participants were largely clonal, and remarkably stable over the 4-year interval, regardless of disease state.     Because they exhibited such broad inter-host variation (38.6±4.7 SNPs/1000bp of genome), and did not cluster according to host pathology, we sought to identify common functional properties by performing GeneChip studies of the responses of a cultured mouse gastric stem cell-like line (mGEPs) to infection with sequenced strains.     The results yielded a shared 695-member set of genes differentially expressed after infection with ChAG-associated, but not normal or heat killed strains: 434 of these genes were also represented in dataset of responses to the cancer-associated strain.      Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that ChAG- and ChAG/cancer- associated responses were  significantly enriched in genes associated with tumorigenesis in general, and gastric carcinogenesis in specific cases.     Whole genome transcriptional profiling of a sequenced ChAG strain during mGEP infection disclosed a set of responses that included upregulation of hopZ, an adhesin belonging to a family of outer membrane proteins.     Expression profiles of wild-type and hopZ? strains revealed a number of pH-regulated genes affected by loss of HopZ, including HopP which binds sialylated glycans produced by GEPs in vivo.     Genetic inactivation of hopZ produces a fitness defect in gnotobiotic transgenic mice but not their wild-type littermates.     This study illustrates an approach for identifying GEP responses specific to ChAG, and bacterial genes important for survival in a gastric ecosystem that lacks parietal cells.     H. pylori strains that had been grown to log phase were used to infect mGEP cells.. After 24h, media and non-attached bacteria were washed off and the cells harvested by trypsinization.     RNA was prepared from bacteria infecting mGEP cells or bacterial cultures  grown in cell media for 24h in the absence of mGEP cells.

 E-GEOD-47061 - Dissecting the specific role of Oct4 during the early stage of reprogramming Differentiated cells can be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)  following the forced overexpression of a specific combination of transcription factors, of which Oct4 is essential.     To better understand the mechanism underlying iPSC reprogramming, we investigated the immediate transcriptional response to ectopic Oct4 expression in somatic cells.     To this end, we derived different somatic cell types from Oct4-inducible transgenic mice and induced Oct4 expression for different time periods.     Using microarray analysis, we have identified early transcriptional Oct4 targets, including genes not previously known to interact with Oct4. Comparison of the sets of Oct4-regulated genes revealed pronounced differences among the individual cell types.     Furthermore, a notable up-regulation of pluripotent markers could not be detected.     In contrast, we observed a down-regulation of somatic markers specific to each cellular population.     This finding suggests that Oct4 interferes with the somatic transcriptional program in a cell type-specific manner, thereby promoting an unstable epigenetic state that facilitates reprogramming rather than the direct initiation of a pluripotent gene expression network.     Finally, we show that Mgarp, a gene expressed in pluripotent cells, is commonly up-regulated in all cell types after Oct4 induction.     Unexpectedly, Mgarp expression decreases during the first steps of reprogramming due to a Klf4-dependent inhibition.     Our data show that Oct4 counteracts Klf4 repressive activity and enhances Mgarp expression at the late stages of reprogramming.     This temporal pattern of Mgarp expression is crucial for the efficient generation of iPSCs. In summary, our study provides new insights into the specific role that Oct4 plays during the early stages of reprogramming.     Different somatic cell types were derived from transgenic mice containing both a tetracycline-inducible transactivator (rtTA-M2) and a tetracycline operon-controlled Oct4 expression cassette (TO) (Hochedlinger 2005, Cell 121:465-477) that were mated with GOF18-GFP mice in which the green fluorescent protein (GFP) is driven by 18 kb of the Oct4 regulatory region (Oct4-GFP) (Yoshimizu 1999, Dev Growth Differ 41:675-684), thus indicating endogenous Oct4 expression.     In addition, a control neural stem cell (CtrlNSC) line was generated from transgenic mice that entail a tetracycline-inducible transactivator (irtTA-VP16-GBD) (Anastassiadis 2002, Gene 298:159-172) plus an OG2 Oct4-GFP reporter transgene (Yoshimizu 1999),but lack a TO cassette.     A second control consisted of wild type (C57BL/6) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (CtrlMEF). Oct4-inducible mouse embryonic fibroblasts (TO-MEFs) and neural stem cell (TO-NSCs) were derived from 14.5 days post coitum (d.p.c.) embryos and cultured as previously described (Conti 2005, PLoS Biol 3:e283). Primary bone marrow cells (TO-BMCs) were isolated from 6-week old mice after flushing femora and tibiae and plated onto dishes with a combined coating of gelatin (PAA, Pasching, Austria), laminin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and poly-L-lysine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Adherent cells were then cultivated in DMEM Low Glucose (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM/L glutamine (all PAA). The transgenic Oct4 expression was induced by either 6 µg/ml doxycycline (Sigma) or by 2 µg/ml doxycycline (Dox) plus 10–7 M dexamethasone (Sigma), depending on the respectively contained tetracycline transactivator.     5-azacytidine (10 nM, Sigma) and cycloheximide (30 µg/ml, Sigma) were applied as indicated.     Generation, culture, and differentiation of ESCs and iPSCs were performed as previously described (Tiemann 2011, Cytometry A 79:426-435). Microarray Gene Expression Analysis Samples from Oct4-inducible cell types and controls were collected at different time points (0, 6, 12, and 24 hours after induction). Biotin-labeled cRNA was prepared with the linear TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) from 500 ng original RNA and hybridized onto MouseRef 8 v2.0 Expression BeadChips (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The chips were stained with streptavidin-Cy3 (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) and scanned using the iScan reader (Illumina). Bead intensities were mapped to gene information using BeadStudio 3.2 (Illumina) and background correction was performed using the Affymetrix robust multiarray analysis model.     Variance stabilization was performed by log2 scaling and the R-Bioconductor lumi package was used for normalization.     17 samples were analyzed.

 E-GEOD-35721 - Spatial organisation of the X inactivation center We report the application of Chromosome Conformation Capture Carbon-copy (5C) to a 4.5 Mb stretch of the mouse X chromosome encompassing the X inactivation center locus.     We uncover a series of discrete 200kb-1Mb topologically associating domains (TADs). These align with several domain-wide epigenomic features as well as co-regulated gene clusters.     5C analysis in EED and G9A mutants reveal that this segmental  organisation in TADs does not relie on the underlying H3K27me3 or H3K9me2 blocks.     Deletion of a boundary between two TADs leads to ectopic chromosomal contacts between them.     Analysis of mESCs, mNPCs and MEFs suggest that the positioning of TADs on the chromosome is stable during cell differentiation though their internal organisation changes.     Comparison of male (XY) and female (XX) differentiated cells highlights that the long-range chromosomal contacts within TADs are dampened on the inactive X compared to the active X. 5C oligonucleotides were designed around HindIII restriction site following an alternative scheme
 E-GEOD-69290 - Reactivation of multipotency by oncogenic PIK3CA induces breast tumor heterogeneity Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women and consists of heterogeneous types of tumours that are classified into different histological and molecular subtypes1-3. Pik3ca and p53 are the two most frequently mutated genes and are associated with different types of human breast cancers4. The cellular origin and the mechanisms leading to Pik3ca-induced tumour heterogeneity remain unknown.     Here, we used a genetic approach in mice to define the cellular origin of Pik3ca-derived tumours and its impact on tumour heterogeneity.     Surprisingly, oncogenic Pik3ca-H1047R expression at physiological levels5 in basal cells (BCs) using K5CREERT2 induced the formation of luminal ER+PR+ tumours, while its expression in luminal cells (LCs) using K8CREERT2 gave rise to luminal ER+PR+ tumours or basal-like ER-PR- tumours.     Concomitant deletion of p53 and expression of Pik3ca-H1047R accelerated tumour development and induced more aggressive mammary tumours.     Interestingly, expression of Pik3ca-H1047R in unipotent BCs gave rise to luminal-like cells, while its expression in unipotent LCs gave rise to basal-like cells before progressing into invasive tumours.     Transcriptional profiling of cells that have undergone cell fate transition upon Pik3ca-H1047R expression in unipotent progenitors demonstrate a profound oncogene-induced reprogramming of these newly formed cells and identified gene signatures, characteristic of the different cell fate switches that occur upon Pik3ca-H1047R expression in BC and LCs, which correlated with the cell of origin, tumour type and different clinical outcomes.     Altogether our study identifies the cellular origin of Pik3ca-induced tumours and reveals that oncogenic Pik3ca-H1047R activates a multipotent genetic program in normally lineage-restricted populations at the early stage of tumour initiation, setting the stage for future intratumoural heterogeneity.     These results have important implications for our understanding of the mechanisms controlling tumour heterogeneity and the development of new strategies to block PIK3CA breast cancer initiation.     Luminal and basal cells, or tumour cells,  from mice in which expression of PIK3CA-H1047R and YFP (and in some conditions loss of p53) was targeted in basal cells using K5CREERT2 or in luminal cells using K8CREERT2 were FACS isolated and RNA was extracted before being hybridized Affymetrix microarrays.

 E-GEOD-64008 - Nucleoporin Nup153 Regulates Stem Cell Pluripotency through Gene Silencing Nucleoporins (Nups) are a family of proteins best known as the constituent building blocks of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), the transport channels that mediate nuclear transport.     Recent evidence suggest that several Nups have additional roles in controlling the activation and silencing of developmental genes, however, the mechanistic details of these functions remain poorly understood.     Here, we show that depletion of Nup153 in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) causes the de-repression of developmental genes and induction of early differentiation.     This loss of pluripotency is not associated with defects in global nucleo-cytoplasmic transport activity.     Instead, Nup153 binds to the transcriptional start site (TSS) of developmental genes and mediates the recruitment of the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) to its target loci.     Our results reveal a nuclear transport-independent role of Nup153 in maintaining stem cell pluripotency and introduce a role of NPC proteins in mammalian epigenetic gene silencing.     RNA-seq, ChIP-Seq, and DamID-Seq for Nup153, Oct4, and key chromatin regulators in mouse ES cells and neural progenitors
 E-GEOD-57092 - Suv39h-dependent H3K9me3 represses intact retrotransposons in mouse embryonic stem cells Heterochromatin is required to restrict aberrant expression of retrotransposons, but it remains poorly defined due to the underlying repeat-rich sequences.     We dissected Suv39h-dependent histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) by genome-wide ChIP-sequencing in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Refined bioinformatic analyses of repeat subfamilies indicated selective accumulation of Suv39h-dependent H3K9me3 at interspersed repetitive elements that cover ~ 5% of the ESC epigenome.     The majority of the ~ 8,150 intact long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), but only a minor fraction of the   1.8 million degenerate and truncated LINEs/ERVs, are enriched for Suv39h-dependent H3K9me3. Transcriptional repression of these intact LINEs and ERVs is differentially regulated by Suv39h and other chromatin modifiers in ESCs but governed by DNA methylation in committed cells.     These data provide a novel function for Suv39h-dependent H3K9me3 chromatin to specifically repress intact retrotransposon elements in the ESC epigenome.     ChIP-seq and RNA-seq in mouse ES cells, Neural precursors and MEFs wild type and Suv39h double KO. The input for ES cells is accessioned as GSM1251941.  A link to this sample can be found below.
 E-GEOD-51746 - ChIP-seq of MOF, MSL and NSL complex members in mouse ES cells and neuronal progenitors We assessed the genome-wide binding of the histone acetylase MOF and members of its two associated complexes, the male-specific lethal and the non-specific lethal complex (MSL, NSL). We generated ChIP-seq profiles for MOF, MSL1, MSL2, KANSL3, and MCRS1 from mouse embryonic stem cells and neuronal progenitor cells.      By using two replicates per sample and stringent filtering criteria, we identify five basic groups of genome regions where the proteins show either mutual or exclusive binding.     We find that the NSL complex members (KANSL3, MCRS1) target the TSSs of broadly expressed genes with housekeeping functions in both cell types.     MOF and particularly the MSL complex target a subset of these NSL-complex-targets, too.     In addition, we find several thousand TSS-distal binding sites, particularly in ESCs, where KANSL3, MSL2 and MCRS1 show strong enrichments for annotated ESC enhancers.     The vast majority of the binding to these ESC distal regulatory elements is lost in NPCs. Finally, we identify mostly intronic and intergenic regions with predominant MSL2 enrichments without the presence of its known interactors.     These binding sites do not overlap with ESC marks of active chromatin (e.g. DNase hypersensitivity sites), but the they increase in number upon differentiation and we detect a strong signature of the (CAGA)n motif.     Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of MOF in the context of its two complexes in the mouse and reveals shared as well as distinct and dynamic functions for gene regulation and pluripotency.     ChIP-seq of MOF and members of its associated complexes (MSL complex: MSL1, MSL2; NSL complex: KANSL3, MCRS1) in male mouse embryonic stem cells and  neuronal progenitor cells derived from them.
 E-GEOD-44242 - Genome-wide maps of Cbx3 in pluripotent mESC and pre-iPSCs We examined the locations of Cbx3 by chromatin immunoprecipitation in ESCs and pre-iPSCs Examination of Cbx3 in mESC (mouse embryonic stem cells) and pre-iPSCs (fibroblast derived partially reprogrammed cells)
 E-GEOD-21343 - Global gene expression profiles of mouse ESCs, disease-specific iPSCs, and gene-corrected iPSCs The use of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells as treatment for genetic diseases entails genetic repair or transfer of genetic information as a prerequisite.     We have chosen the murine model of tyrosinemia type 1 (fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase deficiency; FAH(-/-) mice) as a paradigm for hereditary metabolic liver disorders and evaluated fibroblast-derived FAH(-/-)-iPS cell lines as targets for gene correction.     By aggregating FAH(-/-)-iPS cells with tetraploid embryos, we obtained FAH-/--iPS cell–derived mice, which exhibited the phenotype of the founding FAH(-/-)-mice.     We then rescued the diseased phenotype by lentiviral transduction of FAH-cDNA and performed embryo aggregation with these gene-corrected FAHgc-iPS cells to obtain viable healthy mice.     Our results demonstrate that iPS cell technology is a valid approach to establish mouse disease models directly from somatic cells bearing genetic defects.     Furthermore, established iPS cell lines can be genetically manipulated without loss of pluripotency for treatment of genetic diseases.     6 samples: 1 MEF, 1ESC, 4 iPSCs
 E-GEOD-46719 - Murine splenic macrophage Cells: Control mice vs. Schistosoma japonicum-infected mice Macrophages initiate, modulate, and also serve as final effector cells in immune responses during course of schistosomal infections.     Presently, we discussed the roles of the gene expression profile and functional changes of macrophages in immune responses against the Schistosoma japonicum by microarray experiments.     Hierarchical clustering analysis demonstrated that a significant switch in gene transformation associated with a type-1 response and linked with a type-2 cytokine phenotype occurs between 4.5 and 8 weeks post-infection.     Moreover, the gene profiles at 3 later time-points following egg challenge were similar in complexity and magnitude.     These data also showed that there are mostly inhibition in gene expression related TLR, IFN, MHC and TNFrsf at the switch between 4.5 and 8 weeks post-infection, It is suggested that these immunomodulatory genes may be down-regulated in resistance against S. japonicum eggs and granuloma pathology.     The induction of alternatively activated macrophage was important for dampening the inflammation in hepatic granulomas and contributing to a decrease in cytotoxicity.     The genes expressions involved in repair/remodeling during liver fibrosis were also observed after eggs production.     Understanding these immune mechanisms related to parasite resistance, pathology, and growth with regard to the disease will be helpful in further studies on S. japonicum.     Two-condition experiment, Control mice vs. Schistosoma japonicum-infected mice.     replicates: 2 infected replicates.     Different post-infection weeks
 E-GEOD-61997 - m6A RNA Methylation is Critical for Adequate Exit from Naïve Pluripotency and Execution of Mammalian Development (RNA-Seq) In this study we identify Mettl3, an m6A RNA modification writer, as a critical regulator for terminating naïve pluripotency and a positive maintainer of primed pluripotency in vitro and in vivo.     Remarkably, Mettl3 knockout pre-implantation epiblasts and naïve ES cells, entirely lack m6A on coding mRNAs and are viable.     Yet, they fail to adequately terminate the naïve pluripotent state, and subsequently undergo aberrant priming and early lineage commitment at the post-implantation stage.      A comprehensive functional and genomic analysis involving profiling of m6A, RNA transcription and translation in Mettl3 wild-type and knockout pluripotent and differentiated cells, identified m6A as a critical determinant that destabilizes secondary naïve specific pluripotency genes Esrrb, Klf4 and Nanog, and restrains their transcript stability and translation efficiency.      In summary, our findings provide for the first time evidence for a critical role for an mRNA epigenetic modification in early mammalian development in vivo, and identify a mechanism that functionally regulates mouse naïve and primed pluripotency in an opposing manner.     polyA RNA-seq was measured in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and embroid bodies (EBs), each in WT and in Mettl3-KO cell lines.     RNA-seq was measured also from WT mouse embronic fibroblasts (MEF). 3 biological replicates are available from ESCs and 2 from EBs. Replicate C in ESCs was measured alongside protein levels (SILAC) and was used for the analysis of that assay.

 E-GEOD-48411 - Reprogramming of mouse somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells using a combination of small molecules Somatic cells can be reprogrammed to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by overexpression of four transcription factors, Oct4, Klf4, Sox2, and c-Myc. Bmi1  is responsible for conversion of adult mouse astrocytes and fibroblasts into neural stem cell-like cells and conversion of fibroblasts into iPSCs under enforced expression of Oct4. Here, in the first step of generating iPSCs, stable intermediate cells were generated from mouse astrocytes by Bmi1 in the absence of other transcription factors.     These cells [called induced epiblast stem cell (EpiSC)-like cells (iEpiSCLCs)] are similar to EpiSCs in terms of expression of specific markers, epigenetic state, and ability to differentiate into three germ layers.     Treatment with MEK/ERK and GSK3 pathway inhibitors in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor resulted in conversion of iEpiSCLCs into iPSCs that were similar to mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), suggesting that Bmi1 is sufficient to reprogram astrocytes to pluripotency.     Next, Bmi1 function was replaced with Shh activators (oxysterol and purmorphamine), which demonstrated that specific combinations of small molecules alone can reprogram mouse fibroblasts into iPSCs. These iPSCs resembled mESCs in terms of global gene expression profile, epigenetic status, and developmental potential, demonstrating that combinations of small molecules can compensate for reprogramming factors and are sufficient to directly reprogram mouse somatic cells into iPSCs. 4 Affymetrix and 4 Agilent samples
 E-GEOD-52566 - Enhanced Direct Conversion into Hepatocyte-like Cells by Accelerated Sequential Epigenetic Events using Additional Stem Cell Factors Recent studies have shown that defined sets of transcription factors could directly convert fibroblasts into induced hepatocytes (iHeps). However, the underlying mechanism of direct conversion process toward a hepatic lineage is largely unknown.     Here, we report that the direct conversion kinetics from fibroblasts into iHeps throughout screening multiple additional factors that potentially rescue the delayed kinetics of MET and hepatic program.     Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were efficiently converted into iHeps in the presence of c-Myc and Klf4 (CK), the activators for MET process, with the previously defined sets of hepatic transcription factors, resulting in remarkably improved generation of iHeps.     Furthermore, in the presence of CK, Hnf4α alone could convert fibroblasts into iHeps within 5 days with a relatively higher efficiency.     Cells transduced with different combinations of factors were cultured in standard Hep medium.     Epithelial colonies were observed within 5 days with much higher numbers in the presence of additional factor, c-Myc and Klf4, compared to control group, indicating the number of epithelial colony was dramatically increased in the presence of additional stem cell factors

The reaction contained a 1:1 mixture of 5-(3-aminoallyl) thymidine 5'-triphosphate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and thymidine triphosphate (TTP) in place of TTP.  cDNA products were bound to QIAquick PCR Purification columns (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions, washed three times with 80% ethanol, and eluted with water.      Purified cDNA was reacted with N-hydroxy succinimide esters of Cy3 or Cy5 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) following the manufacturer's instructions.      Hydroxylamine-quenched Cy-labeled cDNAs were separated from free dye molecules using QIAquick columns.      Mixed labeled cDNAs were added to hybridization buffer containing 1 M NaCl, 0.5% sodium sarcosine, 50 mM methyl ethane sulfonate (MES), pH 6.5, 33% formamide and 40 µg herring sperm DNA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California).  Hybridizations were carried out in a final volume of 0.5 ml injecting into an Agilent hybridization chamber at 42°C on a rotating platform in a hybridization oven (Robbins Scientific Corporation, Sunnyvale, California) for 16-24 h. Slides were then washed (rocking ~30 seconds in 6x SSPE, 0.005% sarcosine, then rocking ~30 seconds in 0.06x SSPE) and scanned with a 4000A microarray scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, California).  Each array was hybridized with two samples simultaneously, each from a different pool.        Image processing and data normalization:  TIFF images were quantitated with GenePix (Axon Instruments).  Individual channels were spatially detrended (i.e overall correlations were removed between spot intensity and position on the slide) by subtracting from each spot's log intensity a weighted average of the log intensities of nearby spots.      Most weights were a product of two Gaussian functions, one of the difference in rows between the spots and one of the difference in columns, however 10% of the spots ("high expressors") were always assigned a weight of zero.      The widths of the row and column Gaussians were chosen to minimize the sum, across all spots, of the squared difference between the weighted average and the actual log intensity of the spots.      The "high expressors" spots were those with the largest difference between their log intensity and the median log intensity over a 7x7 window of neighboring spots.      After spatial detrending, we transformed the log intensities back into linear intensities and all single-channels were normalized to each other (in the linear domain), using channel-specific affine transforms.      That is, for each single channel, we normalized all the detrending intensities by adding an offset parameter (which was possibly negative) and then multiplying by a positive scale parameter.      The scale and offset parameters of each channel's transform were set so that the median intensities and the difference between the 75th and 25th percentile intensities were identical across channels.
 E-GEOD-36290 - High-throughput sequencing of sequentially reprogrammed iPS cells reveals key epigenetic modifications correlated with reduced pluripotency of iPS cells [RNA-seq] Full pluripotency of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells has been determined as viable all-iPS mice can be generated through tetraploid complementation.     Subsequently, activation of imprinted Dlk-Dio3 gene cluster has been suggested to correlate with the pluripotency of iPS cells1. However, evidence from recent studies has demonstrated that loss of imprinting at the Dlk-Dio3 locus did not correlate strictly with the reduced pluripotency of iPS cells.     Therefore, it becomes indispensable to exploit other reliable molecular markers for evaluating the quality of iPS cells accurately.     In the present study, we successfully utilize the sequential reprogramming approach and produce all-iPS mice to six generations using iPS cell lines derived from different cell lineages which contain the same proviral integration in the genome.     By comparing the global gene expression and epigenetic modifications of both &quot;tetra-on&quot; and corresponding &quot;tetra-off&quot; iPS cell lines established from either mesenchymal or hematopoietic lineages through deep sequencing analysis of mRNA expression, small RNA profiling, histone modifications (H3K4m2, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) and DNA methylation, very few differences are detected among all the iPS cell lines investigated.     However, we find that two imprinted genes, disruption of which correlate with the reduced pluripotency of iPS cells.     Therefore, our data not only provide the first demonstration that producing of all-iPS mice to six generations is feasible, but reveal that two imprinted regions can be served as pluripotency markers of iPS cells.

 E-GEOD-39522 - Differences in CTCF binding site sequence are associated with unique regulatory and functional trends during embryonic stem cell differentiation [RNA-Seq] CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) is a highly conserved 11-zinc finger DNA binding protein with tens of thousands of binding sites genome-wide.     CTCF acts as a multifunctional regulator of transcription, having been previously associated with activator, repressor, and insulator activity.     These diverse regulatory functions are crucial for preimplantation development and are implicated in the regulation of numerous lineage-specific genes.      Despite playing a critical role in  developmental gene regulation, the mechanisms that underlie developmental changes in CTCF recruitment and function are poorly understood.     Our previous work suggested that differences in CTCF’s binding site sequence may affect the regulation of CTCF recruitment, as well as CTCF’s regulatory function.     To investigate these two possibilities directly during a developmental process, changes in genome-wide CTCF binding and gene expression were characterized during in vitro differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells.     CTCF binding sites were initially separated into three classes (named LowOc, MedOc, and HighOc) based on similarity to the consensus motif.      The LowOc class, with lower-similarity to the consensus motif, is more likely to show changes in binding during differentiation.      These more dynamically bound sites are enriched for motifs that confer a lower in vitro affinity for CTCF, suggesting a mechanism where sites with low-binding affinity are more amenable to developmental control.     Additionally, by comparing changes in CTCF binding with changes in gene expression during differentiation, we show that LowOc and HighOc sites are associated with distinct regulatory functions.      In sum, these results suggest that the regulatory control of CTCF’s binding and function is dependent in part upon specific motifs within its DNA binding site.     Mouse E14 ES cells were differentiated in vitro for 4.5 days using retinoic acid.     RNA-Seq was performed from cells collected before and after differentiation.

However, evidence from recent studies has demonstrated that loss of imprinting at the Dlk-Dio3 locus did not correlate strictly with the reduced pluripotency of iPS cells.     Therefore, it becomes indispensable to exploit other reliable molecular markers for evaluating the quality of iPS cells accurately.     In the present study, we successfully utilize the sequential reprogramming approach and produce all-iPS mice to six generations using iPS cell lines derived from different cell lineages which contain the same proviral integration in the genome.     By comparing the global gene expression and epigenetic modifications of both “tetra-on” and corresponding “tetra-off” iPS cell lines established from either mesenchymal or hematopoietic lineages through deep sequencing analysis of mRNA expression, small RNA profiling, histone modifications (H3K4m2, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) and DNA methylation, very few differences are detected among all the iPS cell lines investigated.     However, we find that two imprinted genes, disruption of which correlate with the reduced pluripotency of iPS cells.     Therefore, our data not only provide the first demonstration that producing of all-iPS mice to six generations is feasible, but reveal that two imprinted regions can be served as pluripotency markers of iPS cells Examination of DNA methylation in 13 cell types

 E-GEOD-39502 - Differences in CTCF binding site sequence are associated with unique regulatory and functional trends during embryonic stem cell differentiation [ChIP-Seq] CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) is a highly conserved 11-zinc finger DNA binding protein with tens of thousands of binding sites genome-wide.     CTCF acts as a multifunctional regulator of transcription, having been previously associated with activator, repressor, and insulator activity.     These diverse regulatory functions are crucial for preimplantation development and are implicated in the regulation of numerous lineage-specific genes.      Despite playing a critical role in  developmental gene regulation, the mechanisms that underlie developmental changes in CTCF recruitment and function are poorly understood.     Our previous work suggested that differences in CTCF’s binding site sequence may affect the regulation of CTCF recruitment, as well as CTCF’s regulatory function.     To investigate these two possibilities directly during a developmental process, changes in genome-wide CTCF binding and gene expression were characterized during in vitro differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells.     CTCF binding sites were initially separated into three classes (named LowOc, MedOc, and HighOc) based on similarity to the consensus motif.      The LowOc class, with lower-similarity to the consensus motif, is more likely to show changes in binding during differentiation.      These more dynamically bound sites are enriched for motifs that confer a lower in vitro affinity for CTCF, suggesting a mechanism where sites with low-binding affinity are more amenable to developmental control.     Additionally, by comparing changes in CTCF binding with changes in gene expression during differentiation, we show that LowOc and HighOc sites are associated with distinct regulatory functions.      In sum, these results suggest that the regulatory control of CTCF’s binding and function is dependent in part upon specific motifs within its DNA binding site.     Mouse E14 ES cells were differentiated in vitro for 4.5 days using retinoic acid.     ChIP-seq for CTCF and an IgG control was performed from cells collected before and after differentiation.     For undifferentiated cells, data were generated in two biological replicates.
 E-GEOD-71933 - NANOG alone induces germ cells in primed epiblast in vitro by activation of enhancers Nanog, a core pluripotency factor in the inner cell mass of blastocysts, is also expressed in unipotent primordial germ cells (PGC) in mice1, where its precise role is yet unclear2-4. We investigated this in an in vitro model, where naïve pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) cultured in bFGF/ActivinA develop as epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs), and gain competence for PGC-like fate5. Consequently, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP4), or ectopic expression of key germline transcription factors Prdm1/ Prdm14/ Tfap2c, directly induce PGC-like cells (PGCLCs) in EpiLCs, but not in ESCs6-8. Here we report an unexpected discovery that Nanog alone can induce PGCLCs in EpiLCs, independently of BMP4. We propose that following the dissolution of the naïve ESC pluripotency network during establishment of EpiLCs9,10, the epigenome is reset for cell fate determination.     Indeed, we found genome-wide changes in NANOG binding pattern between ESCs and EpiLCs, indicating epigenetic resetting of regulatory elements.     Accordingly, we show that NANOG can bind and activate enhancers of Prdm1 and Prdm14 in EpiLCs in vitro; BLIMP1 (encoded by Prdm1) then directly induces Tfap2c. Furthermore, while SOX2 and NANOG promote the pluripotent state in ESCs, they show contrasting roles in EpiLCs since Sox2 specifically represses PGCLC induction by Nanog.     This study demonstrates a broadly applicable mechanistic principle for how cells acquire competence for cell fate determination, resulting in the context-dependent roles of key transcription factors during development.

 E-GEOD-70816 - Reprogramming roadblocks are system-dependent Since the first generation of induced Pluripotent Stem cells (iPSCs), several reprogramming systems have been used to study its molecular mechanisms.     However, the system of choice largely affects the reprogramming efficiency, influencing our view on the mechanisms.     Here we demonstrate that reprogramming triggered by less efficient polycistronic reprogramming cassettes not only highlights Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition (MET) as a roadblock, but also faces more severe difficulties to attain a pluripotent state even post-MET. Also, in contrast to previous findings, more efficient cassettes can reprogram both wild type and Nanog-/- fibroblasts with comparable efficiencies, routes and kinetics, rebutting previous studies that Nanog is critical for iPSC generation.     We revealed that the 9 amino acids in the N-terminus of Klf4 in polycistronic reprogramming cassettes are the dominant factor causing these critical differences.     Our data establishes that some reprogramming roadblocks are system-dependent, highlighting the need to pursue mechanistic studies with close attention to the systems to better understand reprogramming.     The aim of the experiment is to compare the reprogramming pathways driven by two different polycistronic cassettes (MKOS and OKMS). We have isolated cells at intermediate stages of both MKOS and OKMS reprogramming and analysed their gene expression profiles.     2N- are CD44- ICAM1-, Nanog-GFP-, 3N- are CD44- ICAM1+, Nanog-GFP-, 3N+ are CD44- ICAM1+, Nanog-GFP+, all from day 10 of reprogramming.

 E-GEOD-4880 - Response to low dose ionizing radiation in male mouse Male mice 10-14 weeks of age were exposed in vivo to 10 rad X-ray.      The objective is to extract information on gene networks from the microarray data.     Control mice were sham-exposed.      Spleen was harvested 3.5 hrs post-irradiation.      Each hybridization consists of one control mouse and one exposed mouse randomly paired to form a biological replicate.      Each biological replicate was hybridized in duplicate, incorporating a dye swap to control for dye-specific effects.
 E-MTAB-357 - Effects of in vivo transfection with anti-miR-214 on gene expression in murine molar tooth germ The tooth is derived from both the ectoderm and the neural crest (ectomesenchyme). It is often used as a model for studies of the basic mechanisms of organ development, including differentiation, cellular interaction, morphogenesis, and mineralization of extracellular matrices.     In mouse, tooth development begins at embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) by thickening of the dental epithelium, whereas mineralization of enamel and dentin in first molars starts at postnatal day 0 (P0). Tooth development entails a multistep and complex process of gene expression.     Studies with genetically modified mice have contributed substantially to our understanding of genes that regulate tooth development and morphology.     MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a class of non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at a post-transcriptional level, and are considered as important regulatory molecules during foetal development.     By binding to target mRNAs, miRNA induce mRNA decay or translation repression.     Recent bioinformatic predictions of miRNA targets in vertebrates indicate that hundreds of miRNAs are responsible for regulation of expression of up to 30% of the human protein-coding genes.     Recent experiments has verified that miRNAs can regulate expression of hundreds of mRNAs in cultured cells.     Previous study has also shown that microarrays can be used to detect physiologically relevant effects of miRNAs on expression of mRNAs in vertebrates; miRNAs have been shown to alter expression of a greater number of transcripts than previously appreciated, primarily through interaction with 3´UTRs. Understanding the biological function of miRNAs require knowledge of their mRNA targets.     Bioinformatic approaches have been used to predict mRNA targets, among which both transcription factors and pro-apoptopic genes were prominent candidates.     The precise molecular function of miRNAs remains largely unknown and a better understanding may require loss-of-function studies in vivo.     It has been shown that intravenous administration of a novel class of chemically engineered oligonucleotides termed antagomirs resulted in a marked reduction of corresponding miRNA levels in most tissues.     This resulted in upregulated expression of hundreds of genes predicted to be repressed by miR-122 because these genes had a miR-122 recognition motif in their 3´UTR region.     Paradoxically, antagomir treatment also revealed a significant number of downregulated genes that may be activated by miR-122. The mechanism by which miRNAs may activate gene expression in vivo is unknown.     However, it may involve an indirect effect (the suppression of a transcriptional repressor), or alternatively, miRNA may have a direct effect on gene activation (e.g. chromatin remodeling). Studies of microRNA expression profiles of the developing murine molar tooth germ have shown these to be highly dynamic, some miRNAs being abundantly expressed during the early development of the molar tooth germ, while others are highly expressed only at later developmental stages.     A recent study also suggested that miRNAs modulate tooth morphogenesis and ameloblast differentiation, perhaps largely by fine tuning conserved signaling networks.     The function of microRNA-214 (miR-214) is unknown, however, it has been related to normal growth and skeletal development in mice.     In tooth germs miR-214 is more highly expressed during later developmental stages.     It was selected as a target for silencing using anti-miR-214. Here we report effects from injections of 1-100 pmol of anti-miR-214 close to developing first mandibular molar in newborn mice.      At 24 hrs, or more, after injection significant changes in gene expression, and in levels of several correspondingly encoded proteins, were found in the tooth germ.

 E-GEOD-42851 - A Unifying Model for Molecular Determinants of the Pre-selection Vβ Repertoire [ChIP-chip] Chip-chip from pro-T(DN) cells from Rag1KO mice for H3K27ac, P300 and FAIRE The primary antigen receptor repertoire is sculpted by the process of V(D)J recombination, which must strike a balance between diversification and favoring gene segments with specialized functions.     The precise determinants of how often gene segments are chosen to complete variable region coding exons remain elusive.     We have quantified Vβ usage in the pre-selection Tcrb repertoire and report relative contributions of 14 distinct features in shaping their recombination efficiencies, including transcription, chromatin environment, spatial proximity to their DβJβ targets, and quality of recombinase recognition elements.     Computational analyses provide a unifying model, revealing a minimal set of eight parameters that are predictive of Vβusage, dominated by chromatin modifications associated with transcription, but largely independent of the precise spatial proximity to DβJβclusters.

 E-GEOD-23573 - B-cell KO mice data Using a systems biology approach, we discovered and dissected a three-way interaction between the immune system, the intestinal epithelium, and the microbiota.     We found that mice lacking B lymphocytes, or lacking IgA, have low intestinal expression of lipid metabolism genes regulated by the transcription factor GATA4, and a consequent decrease in fat absorption in the intestine.     The defect disappeared in germ free mice, suggesting that it is dependent on the microbiota; and sequencing analysis of the bacteria showed subtle differences between normal and B-cell deficient mice.     Analysis of gene expression of gut biopsies from patients with common variable immunodeficiency and intestinal dysfunction revealed a high similarity to mouse B-cell knockout profiles.     These data provide an explanation for a longstanding enigmatic association between immunodeficiency and defective lipid absorption in humans.     This series represents first part of the study including: 1) B-cell KO mice of different strains and their controls 2) germ free B-cell Ko mice and their controls 3) B lymphocytes Intensity of each channel was extracted from two-color arrays.     We used direct dye swap design and performed paired analysis between small intestine of KO and control mice.     Corresponding pairs of KO and control were hybridized on the same array and can be matched by the array name.     For comparison between B lymphocytes and intestinal tissue we used B-cell KO intestinal samples and B lymphocytes samples balancing the number of Cy5/3 labeled samples in the groups.

 E-GEOD-18404 - High-density gene expression analysis of tumor-associated macrophages from mouse mammary tumors Clinical and experimental evidence indicates that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) promote malignant progression.     In breast cancer, TAMs enhance tumor angiogenesis, tumor cell invasion, matrix remodeling, and immune suppression against the tumor.     In this study, we examined late-stage mammary tumors from a transgenic mouse model of breast cancer.     We used flow cytometry under conditions that minimized gene expression changes to isolate a rigorously defined TAM population previously shown to be associated with invasive carcinoma cells.     The gene expression signature of this population was compared with a similar population derived from spleens of non-tumor-bearing mice using high-density oligonucleotide arrays.     Using stringent selection criteria, transcript abundance of 460 genes was shown to be differentially regulated between the two populations.     Bioinformatic analyses of known functions of these genes indicated that formerly ascribed TAM functions, including suppression of immune activation and matrix remodeling, as well as multiple mediators of tumor angiogenesis, were elevated in TAMs. Further bioinformatic analyses confirmed that a pure and valid TAM gene expression signature in mouse tumors could be used to assess expression of TAMs in human breast cancer.     The data derived from these more physiologically relevant autochthonous tumors compared with previous studies in tumor xenografts suggest tactics by which TAMs may regulate tumor angiogenesis and thus provide a basis for exploring other transcriptional mediators of TAM trophic functions within the tumor microenvironment.     Tumor-associated macrophages from late-stage mouse mammary tumors compared to splenic macrophages from non-tumor-bearing littermate controls.     4 biological replicates of each population were compared via gene expression arrays.
 E-GEOD-17863 - mRNA profiling reveals divergent roles of PPARa and PPARß/d in regulating mouse liver gene expression (PPARa samples) Little is known about the role of the transcription factor PPARß/d in liver.     Here we set out to better elucidate the function of PPARß/d in liver by comparing the effect of PPARa and PPARß/d deletion using whole genome transcriptional profiling and analysis of plasma and liver metabolites.     In fed state, the number of genes altered by PPARa and PPARß/d deletion was similar, whereas in fasted state the effect of PPARa deletion was much more pronounced, consistent with the pattern of gene expression of PPARa and PPARß/d. Minor overlap was found between PPARa- and PPARß/d-dependent gene regulation in liver.     Pathways upregulated by PPARß/d deletion were connected to innate immunity.     Pathways downregulated by PPARß/d deletion included lipoprotein metabolism and various pathways related to glucose utilization, which correlated with elevated plasma glucose and triglycerides and reduced plasma cholesterol in PPARß/d-/- mice.     Downregulated genes that may underlie these metabolic alterations included Pklr, Fbp1, Apoa4, Vldlr, Lipg, and Pcsk9, which may represent novel PPARß/d target genes.     In contrast to PPARa-/- mice, no changes in plasma FFA, plasma ß-hydroxybutyrate, liver triglycerides and liver glycogen were observed in PPARß/d-/- mice.     Our data indicate a role for PPARß/d in hepatic glucose utilization and lipoprotein metabolism but not in the adaptive response to fasting.      Keywords: Analysis of target gene regulation by using microarrays Pure-bred Sv129 PPARα -/- mice and corresponding wildtype mice were used.     Male mice (n=4-5 per group) were either fed or fasted for 24 hours.     At the end of the experiment, mice were anaesthetized with a mixture of isofluorane (1.5%), nitrous oxide (70%) and oxygen (30%). Blood was collected by orbital puncture, after which the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation.     Livers were dissected, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC until further analysis.     For RNA analyses, tissue from the same part of the liver lobe was used.
 E-GEOD-12537 - Effect of PCN on CAR and PXR regulated genes involved in circadian rhythm, drug metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis The nuclear receptor PXR (Pregnane X rreceptor) mediates the effects of pregnenolone-16alpha-carbonitrile (PCN) on gene transcription.     The relative role of PXR and also CAR to the induction response by PCN was studied on cDNA arrays containing 320 (Steroltalk V2) genes (genes involved in cyrcadian rhythm, drug metabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis, sterol synthesis/transport, heme synthesis). Samples from livers of wild type and CAR-/-, PXR-/- or CAR/PXR-/- knockout mice were tested after treatment with PCN for gene expression within the European Framework V program “Steroltalk” (www.steroltalk.net). Results from these experiments show the complex role of PXR receptor in the expression of genes involved in cyrcadian rhythm, drug metabolism and cholesterol biosynthesis.     Animals were injected i.p. 40mg/kg PCN or vehicle (5% DMSO in corn oil). After 12h they were sacrificed and total RNA was isolated from the livers.     Pools of untreated samples were mixed in each genetic variant group (wild type and CAR-/-, PXR-/- or CAR/PXR-/-) with the PCN treated ones and hybridized to Steroltalk V2 arrays.

 E-GEOD-46791 - An epigenetic signature of developmental potential in neural stem cells and early neurons [expression] A cardinal property of neural stem cells (NSCs) is their ability to adopt multiple fates upon differentiation.     The epigenome is widely seen as a read-out of cellular potential and a manifestation of this can be seen in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), where promoters of many lineage-specific regulators are marked by a bivalent epigenetic signature comprising trimethylation of both lysine 4 and lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, respectively). Bivalency has subsequently emerged as a powerful epigenetic indicator of stem cell potential.     Here, we have interrogated the epigenome during differentiation of ESC-derived NSCs to immature GABAergic interneurons.     We show that developmental transitions are accompanied by loss of bivalency at many promoters in line with their increasing developmental restriction from pluripotent ESC through multipotent NSC to committed GABAergic interneuron.     At the NSC stage, the promoters of genes encoding many transcriptional regulators required for differentiation of multiple neuronal subtypes and neural crest appear to be bivalent, consistent with the broad developmental potential of NSCs. Upon differentiation to GABAergic neurons, all non-GABAergic promoters resolve to H3K27me3 monovalency, whereas GABAergic promoters resolve to H3K4me3 monovalency or retain bivalency.     Importantly, many of these epigenetic changes occur prior to any corresponding changes in gene expression.     Intriguingly, another group of gene promoters gain bivalency as NSCs differentiate toward neurons, the majority of which are associated with functions connected with maturation and establishment and maintenance of connectivity.     These data show that bivalency provides a dynamic epigenetic signature of developmental potential in both NSCs and in early neurons.     Illumina Expresson BeadChip arrays (MouseRef-8v2.0) were used to assess gene expression changes in neural stem cells (n=5; derived from mouse embryonic stem cells) and their differentiated neuronal progeny (n=3; FACS-purified based on Tau-RedStar expression).
 E-GEOD-74065 - Rapid conversion of fibroblasts into functional forebrain GABAergic interneurons by direct genetic reprogramming Transplantation of GABAergic interneurons (INs) can sustain long-standing benefits in animal models of epilepsy and other neurological disorders.     In a therapeutic perspective, a renewable source of functional GABAergic INs is needed.     Here, we identified five factors (Foxg1, Sox2, Ascl1, Dlx5 and Lhx6) able to convert fibroblasts directly into induced GABAergic INs (iGABA-INs), displaying the molecular signature of telencephalic INs. The selected factors recapitulate in fibroblasts the activation of transcriptional networks required for the specification of GABAergic fate during telencephalon development.     iGABA-INs exhibited progressively maturing firing patterns comparable to those of cortical INs, had synaptic currents and released GABA. Importantly, upon grafting in the hippocampus, iGABA-INs survived, matured and their optogenetic stimulation triggered GABAergic transmission and inhibited the activity of connected granule cells.     The five factors also converted human cells into functional GABAergic neurons.     These properties define iGABA-INs as a promising tool for disease modeling and cell-based therapeutic approaches.     Comparison of iGABA-INs transcriptional profile with those of starting fibroblasts and GAD67-GFP+ cortical interneurons.

(1996) Proc.     Natl.     Acad.     Sci U. S. A 93, 6594-6599) were used for the study.     Animals were derived from the original strain and back-crossed with wildtype 129/SV mice (Institut für Labortierkunde, University of Zurich). Animals were acclimatized to housing in single cages for one week.     Soleus muscle was harvested, total RNA isolated and subjected to transcript profiling with custom microarrays with custom-designed ATLASTM cDNA nylon filter as described (Dapp, C., Schmutz, S., Hoppeler, H. & Fluck, M.

 E-GEOD-33565 - Chitosan-affected gene expression profiles in brain and stomach Chitosan has been widely used in food industry as a weight-loss aid and a cholesterol-lowering agent.     Previous studies have shown that chitosan affects metabolic responses and contributes to anti-diabetic, hypocholestermic, and blood glucose-lowering effects; however, the in vivo targeting sites and mechanisms of chitosan remain to be clarified.     In this study, we constructed transgenic mice which carried the luciferase genes driven by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), a key regulator of fatty acid and glucose metabolism.     Bioluminescent imaging of PPAR transgenic mice was applied to report the organs that chitosan acted on, and gene expression profiles of chitosan-targeted organs were further analyzed to elucidate the mechanisms of chitosan.     Bioluminescent imaging showed that constitutive PPAR activities were detected in brain and gastrointestinal tract.     Administration of chitosan significantly activated the PPAR activities in brain and stomach.     Microarray analysis of brain and stomach showed that several pathways involved in lipid and glucose metabolism were regulated by chitosan.     Moreover, the expression levels of metabolism-associated genes like apolipoprotein B (apoB) and ghrelin genes were down-regulated by chitosan.     In conclusion, these findings suggested the feasibility of PPAR bioluminescent imaging-guided transcriptomic analysis on the evaluation of chitosan-affected metabolic responses in vivo.     Moreover, we newly identified that downregulated expression of apoB and ghrelin genes were novel mechanisms for chitosan-affected metabolic responses in vivo . Mice (6 to 8 weeks old) were subcutaneously injected saline or 0.2 g/kg chitosan.     Chitosan oligosaccharide lactate (MW=4000-6000,  90% deacetylation) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and dissolved in DDW. For rosiglitazone treatment, mice were orally administered 50 mg/kg rosiglitazone.     Mice were then imaged for the luciferase activity or sacrificed for microarray analysis at indicated periods.
 E-GEOD-26029 - SYSTEMATIC TRANSCRIPTIONAL PROFILING OF THE LIVER, HEART, SKELETAL MUSCLE, AND ADIPOSE TISSUE IN INSULIN RESISTANT, DIET-INDUCED OBESE C57BL/6J MOUSE Following 20wk of either chow or high fat feeding, tissues were collected from C57BL/6J mice.     Gene expression in four tissues that have been associated with obesity-related metabolic complications: white adipose tissue (WAT), skeletal muscle, the liver, and the heart were examined.      Data suggest that some tissues may be attempting to reduce the metabolic perturbations that occur in the early stages of obesity.     Also, many identified genes were associated with a variety of disorders, thereby serving as potential links between obesity and related health risks.     After 3 wk of weaning, male C57BL/6J littermates were randomly separated into control (n=6) and treatment (n=6) groups for each tissue.     After an acclimatization period of 1wk, animals were given free access to a chow diet (23% protein, 21% fat, and 55% carbohydrate) or a high fat (HF) diet (15% protein, 59% fat, and 26% carbohydrate) for 20wk. Following the feeding period, animals were fasted for 6h, anesthetized with pentobarbital, and weighed.     Blood glucose was assessed in anesthetized mice.     Non-esterified fatty acids and immunoreactive insulin was assayed with a double antibody method.     Samples of WAT, the liver, gastrocnemius muscle and heart were obtained, frozen with liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80oC until subsequent use.     Tissue samples were homogenized at short intervals of time and total RNA was isolated using cold TRIzol (Invitrogen, Ontario, Canada)  to prevent RNA degradation.     Cdna was prepared to perform the microarrays.     For every treatment sample and its corresponding control, two microarrays were performed in a dye-swap normalization experiment.     Mouse M7K microarray chip from the Southern Alberta Microarray Facility (University of Calgary, Calgary, AB) were used (GEO Accession: Platform GPL3965).

 E-GEOD-54297 - Comparison of mouse genes from the lungs of chronic, acute, tolerant, and non-asthmatic mouse models Microarray analysis of whole lung tissue from three mouse models of asthma Acute asthma was produced by immunization twice, one week apart, of Balb/C mice 8-12 weeks of age with Aspergillus species (5 μg) in adjuvant (1:1 vol/vol). Adjuvant was aluminum and magnesium hydroxide (Pierce). Asthma was initiated by three consecutive intranasal exposures to Aspergillus species (5μg in 15μL saline) and asthma was evaluated 72 hours after the final exposure.     Tolerant asthma was produced by intranasal delivery of Aspergillus species (5μg in 15μL saline) twice a week for six consecutive weeks to Balb/C mice 8-12 weeks of age.     Asthma was evaluated after mice were rested for an additional three weeks.     Chronic asthma was produced by intranasal delivery of the Dustmite/ Ragweed/ Aspergillus (5,50,5ug in 15ul saline) mixture twice a week for six consecutive weeks in female mice Balb/C mice 8-12 weeks of age.     Asthma was evaluated 3 weeks after cessation of allergen exposure.     Saline control mice were treated intransally with 15ul of saline twice a week for 6 weeks.     Asthma was assesed 3 weeks after the final exposure.     n=3 samples/ mouse model.
 E-GEOD-40119 - Apoptosis rate and transcriptional response of pancreatic islets exposed to the PPAR gamma agonist Pioglitazone To explore the molecular pathways underlying thiazolidinediones effects on pancreatic islets in conditions mimicking normo- and hyperglycemia, apoptosis rate and transcriptional response to Pioglitazone at both physiological and supraphysiological glucose concentrations were evaluated.     Adult rat islets were cultured at physiological (5.6 mM) and supraphysiological (23 mM) glucose concentrations in presence of 10 mM Pioglitazone or vehicle.     RNA expression profiling was evaluated with the PancChip 13k cDNA microarray after 24-h, and expression results for some selected genes were validated by qRT-PCR.
 E-GEOD-38394 - Differentially regulted genes in neural stem cells treated by oleanolic acid Oleanolic acid significantly inhibited neurosphere formation in a dose-dependent manner, and achieved a maximum effect at 10 nM. OA also reduced the 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation into NSCs, indicating an inhibition on proliferation of NSCs. Next, in western blotting analysis, the protein expression of neuron-specific marker tubulin-βⅢ (TuJ1) and Mash1 was increased, while the astrocyte-specific marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) decreased.     In immunofluorescence analysis, OA significantly elevated the percentage of TuJ1-positive cells and reduced GFAP-positive cells.     Using DNA microarrays, 183 genes were found to be differentially regulated by OA. Neural stem cells derived form mouse embrynic brains were treated with Oleanolic acid or not.     Each group had 4 biological relicates each from a mouse.
 E-MEXP-132 - Transcription profiling of mouse dormant and activated blastocysts Delayed implantation occurs in many mammals, but the underlying mechanisms that direct this process remain largely unknown.     In mice, ovariectomy prior to the preimplantation ovarian estrogen secretion on day 4 of pregnancy initiates blastocyst dormancy, which can be maintained for more than 200 days by continued progesterone treatment.     An injection of estrogen activates blastocysts rapidly and makes them to implant in the progesterone-primed uterus.     Recent establishment of a 60-mer oligo microarray platform, enriched for genes expressed in stem cells and early embryos including preimplantation embryos (7), fulfills this objective.     With an optimized labeling reaction for a small amount of RNA with two rounds of cRNA linear amplification, we compared gene expression differences between dormant and activated blastocysts with validation of microarray data of several key genes at protein expression level using immunohistochemistry.
 E-GEOD-53766 - Targeted chromatin profiling reveals novel enhancers in Ig heavy and light chain loci. Chip-chip from pro-B cells from Rag1KO mice for H3K27ac and RNA Pol II Identification of novel enhancers from Ig heavy and light chain loci Rag1KO pro-B epigenetic landscape at Ig heavy and light chain loci
 E-GEOD-13688 - Effect of TCPOBOP and PCN in combination with high-cholesterol diet on genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis TCPOBOP (1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene) and PCN (pregnenolone 16α-carbonitrile) are inducers of drug metabolism through activation of nuclear receptors CAR (constitutive androstane receptor) and PXR (pregnane X receptor), respectively.     Mouse experiment was designed to study the effect of CAR and PXR activation on cholesterol homeostasis genes and other genes, which are present on the Steroltalk v2 microarray.     Treatments were combined with standard and high-cholesterol diet to observe the interference of high liver cholesterol on nuclear receptor transcription regulation.     All experiments were done within the European sixth Framework program “Steroltalk” (www.steroltalk.net). Results form these experiments give new knowledge about involvement of ‘xenosensors’ CAR and PXR in regulation of endogenous liver metabolism.     Animals were injected i.p. 3mg/kg TCPOBOP, 40 mg/kg PCN or vehicle (corn oil) in combination of one week of standard or 1% cholesterol diet prior tretament.     After 24h they were sacrificed and total RNA was isolated from the livers.     Each sample was hybridized with a reference sample to Steroltalk v2 microarrays.
 E-MEXP-150 - Transcription profiling of mouse metaphase II oocytes collected from 5-6 week old mice with those collected from 40-42 week old mice Decreasing oocyte competence with maternal aging is a major factor in human infertility.     To investigate the age-dependent molecular changes in a mouse model, we compared the expression profiles of metaphase II oocytes collected from 5-6 week old mice with those collected from 40-42 week old mice using the NIA 22K 60-mer oligo microarray.
 E-GEOD-35210 - Age-dependent changes in the gene expression profile of mice over-expressing mutant APP, PS1 and phosphorilated tau In this study, using a microarray approach, we investigated the age-dependent changes in the gene expression profile of  hippocampi obtained from young and old 3xTg-AD and WT control mice, in order to identify the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of AD and assess the role of aging in the development of the disease.     A global gene expression profile in the hippocampi obtained from 3xTgAD (expressing mutant human APP, PS1, and tau) and WT mice at 3 and 12 months of age was studied by employing a Mouse OneArray Whole Genome DNA microarray.     Data were analyzed with the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) in order to achieve a classification of the results on the basis of their biological functions and disclose functional networks and/or pathways.      In this study we performed gene expression profiles for a total of 9 experiments.     Hippocampi were collected from 2 3xTG and 2 WT mice at 3 months of age and from 2 3xTG and 2 WT mice at 12 months of age.     Three MicroArray experiments were performed for each condition (WT 12 moa versus WT 3 moa; 3xTG 3 moa versus WT 3 moa; 3xTG 12 moa versus WT 12moa). On the total of 9 experiments 6 were biological replicates and 3 were technical replicates.
 E-GEOD-24504 - Interorgan coordination of the murine adaptive response to fasting The effects of fasting have been studied extensively, predominantly on isolated processes, within a specific organ.     No comprehensive study of the adaptations was available for different organs, let alone interrelating them, which left the understanding of the body’s orchestration of fasting response limited.      The gene expression profiles of brain, small intestine, kidney, liver and skeletal muscle were therefore studied in mice subjected to short, moderate and prolonged fasting.     Functional category enrichment, network, and text-mining analyses were employed to scrutinize the overall adaptive response, aiming to identify responsive pathways, processes and networks, and their regulation.      The implicated processes did not follow the accepted carbohydrate-lipid-protein succession of energy substrates expenditure.     Instead, they were activated simultaneously in different organs during the whole duration of fasting.     The most prominent changes occurred in lipid and steroid metabolism, especially in the liver and kidney, which showed biochemically similar, orchestrated responses.     They were accompanied by suppression of the immune response and cell turnover, particularly in the small intestine, tied in with increased proteolysis in the muscle.     Enhanced defence against oxidative damage, obvious in all the organs, was the top reaction of the brain, otherwise shown to be extremely well protected from starvation.     The major transcription regulators of fasting response in different organs were FoxO transcription factors, AP-1, p53, cMyc, Sp1, EGF and HNF4α.  The revealed interorgan interactions between metabolic, inflammatory and cell turnover responses are essential when designing strategies to treat the starvation affected individuals, while stressing the significance of using complimentary bioinformatics tools in the high-throughput data analysis.     6 week-old male FVB mice were fasted for 0, 12, 24, 48 or 72 hours before sacrifice (N = 5 per group). From each mouse total RNA was isolated from five organs - liver, small intestine, kidney, brain, and calf muscle.      Five microarrays per experimental condition (five tissues, five timepoints) were performed.     We used a common reference design.     The single common-reference sample was a pool of equal amounts of RNA from all the samples investigated, including additional samples from 5 mice that were fasted for 48 hours and supplemented with vitamin B complex after 24 and 36 hours of fasting.
 E-GEOD-39931 - Murine livers post DEN treatment: c-Jun f/f vs. c-Jun Dli [43MM] Liver carcinogenesis induced by DEN closely mimics the pathologies observed during human liver tumor initiation and progression.     DEN treatment triggered c-Jun expression lasting up to at least 1 week in mouse livers as measured by Western blots and immunohistochemical staining.     DEN-induced liver tumorigenesis was also dramatically reduced in Alfp-cre+/c-jun f/f mice, in which c-Jun is constitutively deleted in hepatocytes around birth.     These data unambiguously demonstrate that c-Jun is specifically required during liver cancer initiation.     We searched for cell death effectors downstream of c-Jun operating in cancer initiation.     Expression profiling revealed that several cell death-associated genes were deregulated by comparing Alfp-cre+/c-junf/f and Alfp-cre-/c-jun f/f livers.     Mouse livers were collected before and 48hours after diethylnitrosamine treament (100mg/kg body weight). Whole genome expression profiles were analyzed using total RNAs extracted from the whole liver samples.     By comparison of the gene expression profiles of these samples, genes with significantly altered expression levels will be selected and further characterized for their roles in DEN-induce liver cell death in tumor initiation.
 E-GEOD-13819 - Identification of pathways and transcription factors relevant to gut inflammation and anti-inflammatory probiotics Using Affymetrix data analysis, important signalling pathways and transcription factors relevant to gut inflammation and anti-inflammatory action of probiotics were identified using the clinically validated probiotic VSL#3 and the IL10-knockout mouse, an animal model for inflammatory bowel disease.     VSL#3 increased expression of genes in volved in PPAR signalling and metabolism of xenobiotics and decreased expression of genes involved in immune response/inflammatory response.     IL10-knockout (IL10-KO) and wildtype (WT) mice housed under specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions were sacrificed at 24 weeks by cervical dislocation.        The study is comprised of two independent Microarray experiments.      Microarray experiment1 compares gene expression of IL10-KO and WT colon tissue.     For microarray analysis RNA was extracted from the colon tissue of each mouse (WT n=7, IL10-KO n=6).   Microarray experiment2 compares gene expression of WT and IL10-KO mice fed with either placebo or probiotic VSL#3. IL10-KO and WT mice were fed with placebo or 1.3x109 cfu of lyophilized VSL#3 bacteria post weaning for 21 weeks.     For microarray analysis RNA was extracted from the caecum tissue of each mouse (WT Placebo n=6, IL10-KO Placebo n=6, IL10-KO VSL#3 n=6).
 E-GEOD-16445 - Identification and validation of novel ERBB2 (HER2, NEU) targets including genes V-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ERBB2; synonyms HER2, NEU) encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein with tyrosine kinase-specific activity that acts as a major switch in different signal-transduction processes.     ERBB2 amplification and overexpression have been found in a number of human cancers, including breast, ovary and kidney carcinoma.     Our aim was to detect ERBB2- regulated target genes that contribute to its tumorigenic effect on a genomewide scale.     The differential gene expression profile of ERBB2- transfected and wild-type mouse fibroblasts was monitored employing DNA microarrays.     Regulated expression of selected genes was verified by RT-PCR and validated by Western blot analysis.     Genomewide gene expression profiling identified (i) known targets of ERBB2 signaling, (ii) genes implicated in tumorigenesis but so far not associated with ERBB2 signaling as well as (iii) genes not yet associated with oncogenic transformation, including novel genes without functional annotation.     We also found that at least a fraction of coexpressed genes are closely linked on the genome.     ERBB2 overexpression suppresses the transcription of antiangiogenic factors (e.g., Sparc, Timp3, Serpinf1) but induces expression of angiogenic factors (e.g., Klf5, Tnfaip2, Sema3c). Profiling of ERBB2-dependent gene regulation revealed a compendium of potential diagnostic markers and putative therapeutic targets.     Identification of coexpressed genes that colocalize in the genome may indicate gene regulatory mechanisms that require further study to evaluate functional coregulation.     Erbb2 transfected NIH3T3 cells versus un-transfected cells, 4 technical replicates including two colour swap experiments
 E-GEOD-39928 - Murine livers post DEN treatment: c-Jun f/f vs. c-Jun Dli [35MM] Liver carcinogenesis induced by DEN closely mimics the pathologies observed during human liver tumor initiation and progression.     DEN treatment triggered c-Jun expression lasting up to at least 1 week in mouse livers as measured by Western blots and immunohistochemical staining.     DEN-induced liver tumorigenesis was also dramatically reduced in Alfp-cre+/c-jun f/f mice, in which c-Jun is constitutively deleted in hepatocytes around birth.     These data unambiguously demonstrate that c-Jun is specifically required during liver cancer initiation.     We searched for cell death effectors downstream of c-Jun operating in cancer initiation.     Expression profiling revealed that several cell death-associated genes were deregulated by comparing Alfp-cre+/c-junf/f and Alfp-cre-/c-jun f/f livers.     Mouse livers were collected before and 48hours after diethylnitrosamine treament (100mg/kg body weight). Whole genome expression profiles were analyzed using total RNAs extracted from the whole liver samples.     By comparison of the gene expression profiles of these samples, genes with significantly altered expression levels will be selected and further characterized for their roles in DEN-induce liver cell death in tumor initiation.
 E-GEOD-39929 - Murine livers post DEN treatment: c-Jun f/f vs. c-Jun Dli [40MM] Liver carcinogenesis induced by DEN closely mimics the pathologies observed during human liver tumor initiation and progression.     DEN treatment triggered c-Jun expression lasting up to at least 1 week in mouse livers as measured by Western blots and immunohistochemical staining.     DEN-induced liver tumorigenesis was also dramatically reduced in Alfp-cre+/c-jun f/f mice, in which c-Jun is constitutively deleted in hepatocytes around birth.

 E-GEOD-24967 - Liver transcriptome comparison of divergently selected Lean and Fat mouse lines in cholesterol homeostasis, bile acids, glucose and lipoprotein metabolism This study aimed to identify molecular basis of obesity-resistant mechanisms in the Lean line with the emphasis on lipid homeostasis.     Expression profiling using custom Steroltalk v2 microarray demonstrated that Lean mice exhibit a higher hepatic expression of cholesterol synthesis genes compared to the Fat line.     A significant difference between the strains was also found in the bile acid metabolism.     We identified novel candidate molecular targets by which we can at least in part explain resistance to obesity development in the Lean line.     Direct comparison of 10 Lean and 10 Fat mouse samples.     For 7 out of 10 comparisons dye-swap technical replication were performed.
 E-GEOD-4784 - Identification of E47 targets In maturing T-lineage cells, the helix-loop-helix protein E47 has been shown to enforce a critical proliferation and developmental checkpoint commonly referred to as β selection.      To examine how E47 regulates cellular expansion and developmental progression, we have used an E2A deficient lymphoma cell line and DNA microarray analysis to identify immediate E47 target genes.      Hierarchical cluster analysis of gene expression patterns revealed that E47 coordinately regulates the expression of genes involved in cell survival, cell growth, lipid metabolism, stress response and lymphoid maturation.       These include Cdk6, CD25, Tox, Gadd45a, Gadd45b, Gfi1, Gfi1b, Socs1, Socs3, Id2, Eto2 and Xbp1.  We propose a regulatory network linking JAK/STAT mediated signaling, E47 and SOCS proteins in a common pathway.       Finally, we suggest that the aberrant activation of Cdk6 in E47 deficient T-lineage cells contributes to the development of lymphoid malignancy.       We used the 1F9 cell line, originally isolated from E2A deficient thymomas.     To identify E47 target genes, 1F9 cells were transduced with a retrovirus carrying an E47/estrogen receptor (E47ER) hybrid protein.      Control cells were transduced with virus carrying the bHLH region but lacking the N-terminal transactivation domain.      Both retroviral constructs also directed the expression of human CD25 (hCD25) to allow rapid isolation of transduced cells.      One day post-infection, cells were incubated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) for a period of six hours, to activate the E47ER fusion protein.      hCD25 positive cells were purified using magnetic beads, RNA was isolated and used to generate probes for hybridization to murine oligonucleotide microarrays.
 E-GEOD-12509 - Effect of TCPOBOP on CAR and PXR regulated genes involved in drug metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis The nuclear receptor CAR (constitutive androstane receptor)  mediates the effects of  1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene (TCPOBOP) on gene transcription.     To investigate the relative role of CAR and also PXR in the induction response, cDNA arrays were generated containing 120 (Sterolgene V1) genes which are known to be regulated with these or related nuclear receptors (genes involved in drug metabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis, sterol synthesis/transport, heme synthesis). Samples from livers of wild type and CAR-/-, PXR-/- or CAR/PXR-/- knockout mice were tested after treatment with TCPOBOP for gene expression within the  European Framework V program “Steroltalk” (www.steroltalk.net). Results from these experiments show the complex role of CAR receptor in the expression of genes involved in drug metabolism and cholesterol biosynthesis.      Animals were injected i.p. 10mg/kg TCPOBOP or vehicle (5% DMSO in corn oil). After 12h they were sacrificed and total RNA was isolated from the livers.     Pools of untreated samples were mixed in each genetic variant group (wild type and CAR-/-, PXR-/- or CAR/PXR-/-) with the TCPOBOP treated ones and hybridized to Sterolgene V1 arrays.
 E-GEOD-5289 - Comparative transcriptional profiling of the lung discriminates S. pneumoniae and Influenza A Virus infections Peumonia is the most common cause of death due to infectious diseases in the western hemisphere.     The molecular events associated with pulmonary infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Influenza A virus are incompletely understood.     Pathophysiological and protective processes are initiated by immune receptors specifically recognizing pathogenic structures serving to elicit a qualitatively and quantitatively adequate immune response.     To provide a molecular framework towards a better understanding of the processes relevant in severe infectious pneumonia we performed a transcriptome analysis of  lungs from mice infected with S. pneumoniae or Influenza A virus.     Overall, we detected 1300 genes that exhibit significant differential expression after infection with either pathogen.     Of those were approximately 36 % specific for pneumococcal and 30 % specific for the viral infection, yielding pathogen-specific as well as common inflammatory transcriptional signatures.     Characteristically, these results resolve not only a differential response on the cytokine and chemokine level, although common induction of type I and type II interferons, TNFa, and  IL-6 underlies both infections, but emphasize the potentially important role exerted by many genes implicated in the regulation and fine tuning of the inflammatory response.     Furthermore, we noted a specific decrease in B cells after S. pneumoniae infection, which is not solely confined to the lung.     Massive induction of apoptosis in pulmonary B cells could reflect a  pneumococcal virulence strategy aiming against the lymphocyte population that is of utmost importance for the defence against capsulated bacteria.     The pathophysiological consequences of Influenza A virus infection become obvious through differential induction of genes implicated in tissue regeneration and proliferation associated with detection of the emerging protective T cell response.      These results may provide new insights into the pathogenesis and protective mechanisms important for the development of improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.        Microarray analyses were performed as two-colour hybridizations.     RNA was labelled with a Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit (Agilent Technologies). Briefly, 4 µg total RNA was reverse transcribed with an oligo-dT-T7 promoter primer and MMLV-RT. Second strand synthesis was carried out with random hexamers.     Fluorescent antisense cRNA was synthesized with either cyanine 3-CTP (Cy3-CTP) or cyanine 5-CTP (Cy5-CTP) and T7 polymerase.     Purified products were quantified at A552nm for Cy3-CTP and A650nm for Cy5-CTP. Prior hybridization, 1.25 µg labelled cRNA each were fragmented, mixed with control targets and hybridization buffer according to the supplier's protocol (Agilent Technologies). Hybridizations were performed for 17 h at 60°C. The slides were washed according to the manufacturer's protocol and scanning of the arrays was performed with 5 µm resolution using a DNA microarray laser scanner (Agilent Technologies). To compensate for dye specific effects, and to ensure validity of the data, a colour swap analysis (fluorescence reversal) was performed.     Features were extracted with the image analysis tool Version A6.1.1.1 from Agilent Technologies.     Subsequent data analyses were carried out on the Rosetta Inpharmatics platform Resolver Built 3.2.2. Differential expression patterns were identified by applying 2-fold expression level cut-offs and an anti-correlation of the dye reversal experiments with an error weighted p-value   0.05.
 E-GEOD-31334 - Abnormal Wnt and PI3Kinase signaling in the malformed intestine of lama5 deficient mice Laminins are major constituents of basement membranes and are essential for tissue homeostasis.     Laminin-511 is highly expressed in the intestine and its absence causes severe malformation of the intestine and embryonic lethality.     To understand the mechanistic role of laminin-511 in tissue homeostasis, we used RNA profiling of embryonic intestinal tissue of lama5 knock out mice combined with cell culture experiments and siRNA mediated knock down and identified a lama5 specific gene expression signature.     Our data provide a mechanistic link between laminin alpha5 gene deficiency and the physiological phenotype.     We show that laminin alpha5 plays a crucial role in both epithelial and mesenchymal cell behavior by regulating Wnt and PI3K signaling.     We provide evidence that a laminin-511 substratum prevents chemical-induced apoptosis in a PI3K-dependent manner and that laminin-511 represses Wnt signaling.     We conclude that conflicting signals are elicited in the absence of lama5, which alter cell adhesion, migration as well as epithelial and muscle differentiation.     Conversely, adhesion to laminin-511 may serve as a potent regulator of the PI3K/Akt and Wnt signaling pathways that are interconnected.     Thus deregulated adhesion to laminin-511 may be instrumental in diseases such as human pathologies of the gut where laminin-511 is abnormally expressed.     The microarray experiments were performed in quadruple with independently prepared RNA from mutant (Laminin alpha5-deficient mouse) and wild-type embryonic intestines derived from 4 different litters.     For each RNA sample, a dye-swap labeling and hybridization was performed using a common reference RNA sample corresponding to 15.5-day embryonic intestines of C57B1/6J mice.
 E-GEOD-32650 - Global gene expression analysis in murine iPS cells derived with mouse, chick and zebrafish Nanog orthologs Nanog null  neural stem (NS) cells were reprogrammed to naive pluripotency in 2i/LIF conditions with chick (c) and zebrafish (z) Nanog orthologs.     Global gene expression was compared to iPS cells derived with mouse (m) Nanog.     Murine iPS cells derived with zebrafish nanog, chick nanog, and mouse nanog orthologs (2 replicates each).
 E-GEOD-77550 - OSKM induce extraembryonic endoderm stem (iXEN) cells in parallel to iPS cells While the reprogramming factors OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and MYC (OSKM) can reactivate the pluripotency network in terminally differentiated cells, they also regulate expression of non-pluripotency genes in other contexts, such as the mouse primitive endoderm.     The primitive endoderm is an extraembryonic lineage established alongside the pluripotent epiblast in the blastocyst, and is the progenitor pool for extraembryonic endoderm stem (XEN) cells.     Several studies have shown that endodermal genes are upregulated in fibroblasts undergoing reprogramming, although whether endodermal genes promote or inhibit acquisition of pluripotency is unclear.     We show that, in fibroblasts undergoing conventional reprogramming, OSKM-induced expression of endodermal genes leads to formation of induced XEN (iXEN) cells, which possess key properties of blastocyst-derived XEN cells, including morphology, transcription profile, self-renewal, and multipotency.     Our data show that iXEN cells arise in parallel to iPS cells, indicating that OSKM are sufficient to drive cells to two distinct fates during reprogramming.     Sequence-based mRNA transcriptional profiling of three different cell lines (MEF, XEN, iXEN) with multiple biological replicates, under two different growth medium conditions (ESC medium, XEN medium) for XEN and iXEN cells.
 E-GEOD-71932 - NANOG alone induces germ cells in primed epiblast in vitro by activation of enhancers  [ChIP-seq] Nanog, a core pluripotency factor in the inner cell mass of blastocysts, is also expressed in unipotent primordial germ cells (PGC) in mice1, where its precise role is yet unclear2-4. We investigated this in an in vitro model, where naïve pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) cultured in bFGF/ActivinA develop as epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs), and gain competence for PGC-like fate5. Consequently, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP4), or ectopic expression of key germline transcription factors Prdm1/ Prdm14/ Tfap2c, directly induce PGC-like cells (PGCLCs) in EpiLCs, but not in ESCs6-8. Here we report an unexpected discovery that Nanog alone can induce PGCLCs in EpiLCs, independently of BMP4. We propose that following the dissolution of the naïve ESC pluripotency network during establishment of EpiLCs9,10, the epigenome is reset for cell fate determination.     Indeed, we found genome-wide changes in NANOG binding pattern between ESCs and EpiLCs, indicating epigenetic resetting of regulatory elements.     Accordingly, we show that NANOG can bind and activate enhancers of Prdm1 and Prdm14 in EpiLCs in vitro; BLIMP1 (encoded by Prdm1) then directly induces Tfap2c. Furthermore, while SOX2 and NANOG promote the pluripotent state in ESCs, they show contrasting roles in EpiLCs since Sox2 specifically represses PGCLC induction by Nanog.     This study demonstrates a broadly applicable mechanistic principle for how cells acquire competence for cell fate determination, resulting in the context-dependent roles of key transcription factors during development.      Nanog ChIP-seq

 E-GEOD-51331 - Therapeutic potential of induced neural stem cells for spinal cord injury The spinal cord does not spontaneously regenerate after injury and a treatment that ensures functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) is still not available.     Recently, fibroblasts have been directly converted into induced neural stem cells (iNSCs) following the forced expression of different combinations of transcription factors.     Although directly converted iNSCs have been considered as a potentialcell source for clinical applications, their therapeutic potential has not been investigated yet.     Here we show that iNSCs directly converted from mouse fibroblasts enhance the functional recovery after SCI in rats.     Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were directly converted into iNSCs using four transcription factors (Brn4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc). iNSCs showed gene expression profiles similar to cNSCs as determined by microarray analysis.     MEFs were derived from C3H mouse strain embryos at embryonic day (E)13.5 after removing the head and all internal organs including the gonads and the spinal cord.     5x10^4 fibroblasts were transduced with replication-defective retroviral particles coding for Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc, and Brn4. After 48 h, the transduced fibroblasts were cultured in standard NSC medium.     iNSC clusters were observed 4-5 weeks after transduction and expanded.     Both MEFs and cNSCs were used as negative and positive control, respectively.
 E-MNIA-68 - Transcription profiling of E12.5 mouse whole embryos and placentas pooled within 3 litters and used to valdiate a new array E12.5 mouse whole embryos and placentas were pooled within 3 litters and total RNA was extracted.     Fluorescently-labeled, linearly-amplified cRNA targets were prepared from the RNA samples and compared on a novel microarray design to validate the system.     A "self-versus-self" experimental design was used to assess the false-positive rates in the system.     The in situ-synthesized 60-mer oligonucleotide microarray platform contains approximately 22,000 DNA features, and was designed to detect transcripts from the entire NIA cDNA clone collection.
 E-GEOD-8372 - Gene regulation in ki-ras transfected murine fibroblasts Ki-ras gene mutations are involved in the carcinogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia, melanoma and different carcinomas.     In order to define potential mutation-specific therapeutic targets, expression profiling analyses were performed using stable transfected NIH3T3 cells carrying different ki-ras gene mutations.     Maybe, this analysis allows the discorvery of ras-associated cellular mechanisms, which might lead to the identification of physiological targets for pharmacological interventions of the treatment of Ki-ras-associated human tumors.     Keywords: cDNA microarray, murine fibroblast, ki-ras mutations, carcinogenesis 4 transfected murine fibroblast cell lines (mock, wt-kras, Asp, Val) were compared to non-transfected cell line.     For each of the four comparison 4 chip experiments were performed including 2 dye swaps.
 E-MTAB-4841 - Transcriptome profiling of dedifferentiating smooth muscle cells from mouse aorta and bladder Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are important in a number of physiological systems and organs, including the cardiovascular system.     The hallmark property of differentiated SMCs is the ability to contract, but contractile SMCs themselves show a range of phenotypes allowing prolonged tonic contraction in vascular smooth muscle or rapid phasic contraction in tissues such as bladder.     Another distinctive characteristic, in contrast with terminally differentiated striated muscle cells, is that SMCs exhibit phenotypic plasticity.     Vascular SMCs are able to modulate their phenotype along a continuum between a contractile phenotype, characteristic of healthy blood vessels, and a more proliferative “synthetic” phenotype, so-named for the enhanced synthesis and secretion of extracellular matrix components.     Synthetic phenotype cells are found in a number of pathological situations such as atherosclerosis and arterial injury.     We used mouse exon-junction (MJAY) arrays to gain insights into both the global contribution of alternative splicing events in re-shaping the transcriptome of dedifferentiating mouse aorta and bladder SMCs, and into the underlying regulatory mechanisms of the alternative splicing program.     Affymetrix splice junction arrays (MJAY) were used to profile changes in both alternative splicing and transcript levels during the phenotypic modulation of smooth muscle cells when placed in culture.     RNA extracted from intact aorta and bladder smooth muscle tissue was used for differentiated samples.     For dedifferentiated, proliferative samples smooth muscle cells were enzymatically dispersed and grown in tissue culture for a week.     Triplicate RNA samples were prepared from smooth muscle tissue of mouse aorta and bladder (differentiated) and from smooth muscle cells from each tissue cultured for 7 days (proliferative).  The samples allowed comparison of alternative splicing (and other transcriptome) changes between differentiated and proliferative smooth muscle cell samples from two distinct types of smooth muscle cell, as well as allowing direct comparison of aorta (tonic smooth muscle) and bladder (phasic smooth muscle).
 E-GEOD-8373 - Gene regulation in Erbb2 transfected NIH3T3 cells using tet-off system V-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ERBB2; synonyms HER2, NEU) encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein with tyrosine kinase-specific activity that acts as a major switch in different signal-transduction processes.     ERBB2 amplification and overexpression have been found in a number of human cancers, including breast, ovary and kidney carcinoma.     Our aim was to detect ERBB2-regulated target genes regulated in Erbb2 transfected murine fibroblast cells after tetracycline treatment to stop the overexpression of ERBB2. Changes in gene expression patterns in these cells after the switch-off of Erbb2 expression was analysed after 8 different periods of time after the treatement (1h-7d). Identification of co-regulated genes and in cluster analysis were performed.     Keywords: Erbb2, cDNA microarrays, murine fibroblasts,  gene expression levels of 8 different measurements after tetracycline treatment (1h, 2h, 4h, 12h, 24h, 3d, 5d and 7d) were compared to the non-treated NIH3T3 cell line.     As control two different untreated NIH3T3 cell line were ananysed.     For all comparisons 4 experiments have been performed including 2 dye swaps.
 E-GEOD-15336 - Eyeless: Pitx3 mutant mouse line, Expression profiling of liver A new mouse mutant arose spontaneously at the 5th inbred generation in a congenic C3H/He line.     Since the mice suffered from anophthalmia or microphthalmia, we referred to this new mutant as eyeless (provisional gene symbol: eyl). The mutation follows an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance and was mapped to chromosome 19 close to Pitx3; complementation tests confirmed that eyl is an allelic variant of aphakia (gene symbol: ak). Sequence analysis of the Pitx3 gene identified an insertion of a G in exon 4 (after cDNA position 416: 416insG). The altered open reading frame is predicted to result in a hybrid protein still containing the Pitx3 homeobox, but 121 new amino acids instead of the OAR domain at its C-terminal part.     The new Pitx3eyl allele shares the ophthalmological and brain defects of the aphakia mouse including the loss of dopamine transporter 1 transcripts in the midbrain.     Moreover, we observed in the mutants an increased extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen, and frequently also hepatosteatosis, combined with a reduced body weight.     Fat mass, fat content and subcutaneous fat are significantly decreased in females, but not in males.     Additionally, we observed a broad spectrum of behavioural changes in the homozygous mutants including reduced forelimb grip strength and increased nociception.     In addition to these alterations being apparent in both sexes, we observed in female Pitx3eyl-/- mice increased anxiety, reduced locomotor activity, reduced object exploration and increased social contacts, but decreased anxiety and increased arousal in males.      Most of these defects identified in the new Pitx3 mutation can also be observed in Parkinson patients.     Therefore, the Pitx3eyl mutant is a valuable new model, because it is the first mutant mouse line carrying a point mutation within the coding region of the Pitx3 gene.     5 male animals, 5 experiments including 2 dye swap hybridisations
 E-GEOD-8551 - Transcriptome of reloaded soleus muscle of Tenascin-C deficient 129/SV mice 1 year-old male Tenascin-C deficient 129/SV mice with the targeted insertion of a beta-lactamase cassette in the NcoI site of exon 2 of the TNC gene (Forsberg, E., Hirsch, E., Frohlich, L., Meyer, M., Ekblom, P., Aszodi, A., Werner, S. & Fassler, R. (1996) Proc.     Natl.     Acad.     Sci U. S. A 93, 6594-6599) were used for the study.     Animals were derived from the original strain and back-crossed with wildtype 129/SV mice (Institut für Labortierkunde, University of Zurich). Animals were acclimatized to housing in single cages for one week followed by 7 days of hindlimb suspension and one day of reloading.     Soleus muscle was harvested, total RNA isolated and subjected to transcript profiling with custom microarrays with custom-designed ATLASTM cDNA nylon filter as described (Dapp, C., Schmutz, S., Hoppeler, H. & Fluck, M. (2004) Physiol Genomics 20, 97-107).    Keywords: Transcriptome Six biological replicas
 E-GEOD-23337 - Gene expression in adipose, liver and skeletal muscle of mice fed a diet with c9, t11 conjugated linoleic acid enriched beef Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) is a collective term for the positional and geometric isomers of linoleic acid.     In recent years CLA has been reported to have anti-carcinogenic, anti-obesity, anti-inflammatory and anti-artherogenic effects.      The aim of this study was to determine the effects of a natural high-CLA enriched beef source on three primary insulin responsive tissues: adipose, liver and skeletal muscle.     ob/ob mice were assigned to one of two diets: a control beef diet, low in c9, t11-CLA (control diet) or a c9, t11-CLA enriched beef diet.     After a 28 day feeding trial, RNA was extracted from adipose, liver and skeletal muscle tissue and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays.
 E-GEOD-47500 - Expression of miR-196a in Huntington's disease transgenic (HD) mice We intend to screen altered genes after overexpression of miR-196a in  HD transgenic mice.     Two transgenic mouse lines were used in this study, including HD transgenic mice and HD transgenic mice overexpressing miR-196a. The mice were all at approximate 12 months of age.     At this point, HD transgenic mice showed severve motor dysfunctions, whereas HD transgenic mice overexpressing miR-196a displayed mild motor dysfunctions.     We used the striatum tissues from 2 HD transgenic mice and 3 HD transgenic mice overexpressing miR-196a. The mice were all at approximate 12 months of age.     Two technique repeats were performed for each sample.
 E-GEOD-26300 - Dose-dependent effects of dietary fat on development of obesity in relation to intestinal differential gene expression in C57BL/6J mice Excessive intake of dietary fat is known to be a contributing factor in the development of obesity.     In this study, we determined the dose-dependent effects of dietary fat on the development of this metabolic condition with a focus on changes in gene expression in the small intestine.     C57BL/6J mice were fed diets with either 10, 20, 30 or 45 energy% (E%) derived from fat for four weeks (n=10 mice/diet). We found a significant higher weight gain in mice fed the 30E% and 45E% fat diet compared to mice on the control diet.     These data indicate that the main shift towards an obese phenotype lies between a 20E% and 30E% dietary fat intake.     Analysis of differential gene expression in the small intestine showed a fat-dose dependent gradient in differentially expressed genes, with the highest numbers in mice fed the 45E% fat diet.     The main shift in fat-induced differential gene expression was found between the 30E% and 45E% fat diet.     Furthermore, approximately 70% of the differentially expressed genes were regulated in a fat-dose dependent manner.     Many of these genes were involved in lipid metabolism-related processes and were already differentially expressed on a 30E% fat diet.     Taken together, we conclude that up to 20E% of dietary fat, the small intestine has an effective ‘buffer capacity’ for fat handling.     From 30E% of dietary fat, a switch towards an obese phenotype is triggered.     We further speculate that especially fat-dose dependently regulated lipid metabolism-related genes are involved in development of obesity.     The proximal, middle, and distal parts of the intestine of mice fed 10, 20, 30, or 45E% dietary fat were analyzed.     10 replicates each.
 E-GEOD-37677 - Ginger and its component ameliorated trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis in mice via modulation of nuclear factor-κB activity and interleukin-1β signaling pathway Colitis is the common pathological lesion of inflammatory bowel diseases, the major chronic inflammatory diseases of intestinal tracts in humans.     In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of ginger extract and its component zingerone in mice with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis.     Mice were administered with TNBS and/or various amounts of ginger and zingerone by an intrarectal route.     The severity of colitis was evaluated by colonic weight/length ratio, macroscopic lesion, and histological examination.     The mechanisms of ginger and zingerone were further elucidated by DNA microarray, ex vivo imaging, and immunohistochemical staining.     Our data showed that treatment with ginger extract and zingerone ameliorated TNBS-induced colonic inflammation and injury in a dose-dependent manner.     Pathway analysis of ginger- and zingerone-regulated gene expression profiles showed that ginger and zingerone significantly regulated cytokine-related pathways.     Network analysis showed that nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were key molecules involved in the expression of ginger- and zingerone-affected genes.     Ex vivo imaging and immunohistochemical staining further verified that ginger and zingerone suppressed TNBS-induced NF-κB activation and decreased the NF-κB and IL-1β protein levels in the colon.     In conclusion, our data showed that ginger improved the TNBS-induced colitis in mice via modulation of NF-κB activity and IL-1β signaling pathway.     Moreover, zingerone might be the active component of ginger responsible for the amelioration of colitis induced by TNBS. A total of 24 mice was randomly divided into four groups of six mice: mock, mice were given with 0.1 ml of 50% ethanol; TNBS, mice were given with 250 mg/kg TNBS in 0.1 ml of 50% ethanol; TNBS/ginger, mice were administered with mixtures containing 250 mg/kg TNBS and various amounts of ginger extract in 0.1 ml of 50% ethanol; TNBS/zingerone, mice were given with mixtures containing 250 mg/kg TNBS and various amounts of zingerone in 0.1 ml of 50% ethanol.     Mice were sacrificed seven days later for histochemical staining, RNA extraction, and ex vivo imaging.
 E-GEOD-39211 - miRNA profiling data of mouse bone marrow samples four days post 5-FU treatment versus untreated controls To identify miRNAs that regulate hematopoietic response after 5-FU-induced injury, we analyzed miRNA expression changes in bone marrow cells from mice with or without 5-FU treatment.     Global miRNA expression profiling of the 5-FU and untreated cohorts showed that 92 miRNAs (among 168 that passed the detection threshold) were significantly upregulated or downregulated, with false discovery rates   5%. Female 6wk-old C57Bl6/J mice were left untreated or given a single dose of 5-FU (150mg/kg).  Four days post treatment whole bone marrow was isolated from each animal (n=3 for treated and n=5 for untreated controls) and lysed for total RNA using Trizol (Invitrogen).  Samples were profiled for miRNA expression using a bead-based profiling methodology (Lu et al., 2008). Profiling data were normalized assuming equal total miRNA expression across samples.     Differential miRNA expression was analyzed by student’s t-test and then calculated for false discovery rate using the Benjamini and Hochberg method.
 E-GEOD-1293 - Hindlimb suspension and reloading study Analysis of effect of hindlimb suspension and reloading on C57Bl/6 mouse soleus muscle.      Experimental groups examined: -Control mice, 14 days -Hindlimb suspension for 7 days -Hindlimb suspension for 7 days, and subsequent reloading for 1 day -Hindlimb suspension for 7 days, and subsequent reloading for 7 days
 E-MEXP-298 - Comparative genomic hybridization of DNA from two recently divergent mouse strains, 12925 and C57BL/6J We have performed CGH analysis using 129S5 DNA competitively hybridised with C57BL/6J DNA to RPCI-23 (C57BL/6J) BAC clones spotted at 1Mb resolution (array protocol 7769)
 E-GEOD-39930 - Murine livers post DEN treatment: c-Jun f/f vs. c-Jun Dli [41MM] Liver carcinogenesis induced by DEN closely mimics the pathologies observed during human liver tumor initiation and progression.     DEN treatment triggered c-Jun expression lasting up to at least 1 week in mouse livers as measured by Western blots and immunohistochemical staining.     DEN-induced liver tumorigenesis was also dramatically reduced in Alfp-cre+/c-jun f/f mice, in which c-Jun is constitutively deleted in hepatocytes around birth.     These data unambiguously demonstrate that c-Jun is specifically required during liver cancer initiation.     We searched for cell death effectors downstream of c-Jun operating in cancer initiation.     Expression profiling revealed that several cell death-associated genes were deregulated by comparing Alfp-cre+/c-junf/f and Alfp-cre-/c-jun f/f livers.     Mouse livers were collected before and 48hours after diethylnitrosamine treament (100mg/kg body weight). Whole genome expression profiles were analyzed using total RNAs extracted from the whole liver samples.     By comparison of the gene expression profiles of these samples, genes with significantly altered expression levels will be selected and further characterized for their roles in DEN-induce liver cell death in tumor initiation.

 E-GEOD-53074 - Transcriptome analysis of cells of different cycling speed during Yamanaka reprogramming Reprogramming somatic cells to induced pluripotency by Yamanaka factors is usually slow and inefficient, and is thought to be a stochastic process.     We identified a privileged somatic cell state, from which acquisition of pluripotency could occur in a non-stochastic manner.     Subsets of murine hematopoietic progenitors are privileged, whose progeny cells predominantly adopt the pluripotent fate with activation of endogenous Oct4 locus after 4-5 divisions in reprogramming conditions.     Privileged cells display an ultrafast cell cycle of ~8 hours.     In fibroblasts, a subpopulation cycling at a similar ultrafast speed is observed after 6 days of factor expression, and is increased by p53-knockdown.     This ultrafast-cycling population accounts for  99% of the bulk reprogramming activity in wildtype or p53-knockdown fibroblasts.     We compared the transcriptomes of the fast cycling cells with those of slower hematopoietic progenitors, bulk fibroblasts and established iPS cells.     3-5 replicates for each of the six cell types were included: 4 replicates for established iPS cells, 4 replicates for bulk mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), 4 replicates for fast cycling MEF, 4 replicates for slow cycling MEF, 5 replicates for fast cycling granulocyte monocyte progenitors (GMP) and 3 replicates for slow cycling GMP.
 E-GEOD-60627 - Dynamically reorganized chromatin is the key for the reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotent cells We investigated genome-wide nucleosome coverage and histone methylation occupancies in somatic MEFs, intermediate pre-iPSCs and fully reprogrammed iPSCs. We found that nucleosome occupancies increased in promoter regions and decreased in intergenic regions in pre-iPSCs and then recover to an intermediate level in iPSCs. Nucleosomes in pre-iPSCs are much more phased than those in MEFs and iPSCs. Bivalent, active, repressive domains are cell type-specific and change dynamically during reprogramming.     HCG and LCG promoters exhibit distinct nucleosome occupancy patterns and are dynamically marked by H3K4me3/H3K27me3 during reprogramming, correspondingly showing different gene activities.     Surprisingly, Vitamin C promotes nucleosome reorganization from pre-iPSCs to iPSCs. CTCF binding sites change dynamically during reprogramming, though they share a conserved binding motif.     Nucleosome occupies CTCF sites to a higher extent in pre-iPSCs than those in MEFs and iPSCs. Taken together, our study reveals that dynamic changes of nucleosome positioning and chromatin organization associated gene regulation during reprogramming.     Examine dynamics of nucleosome positioning and histone modification profiles as well as gene expression regulation during somatic cell reprogramming
 E-GEOD-46792 - An epigenetic signature of developmental potential in neural stem cells and early neurons [ChIP-seq] A cardinal property of neural stem cells (NSCs) is their ability to adopt multiple fates upon differentiation.     The epigenome is widely seen as a read-out of cellular potential and a manifestation of this can be seen in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), where promoters of many lineage-specific regulators are marked by a bivalent epigenetic signature comprising trimethylation of both lysine 4 and lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, respectively). Bivalency has subsequently emerged as a powerful epigenetic indicator of stem cell potential.     Here, we have interrogated the epigenome during differentiation of ESC-derived NSCs to immature GABAergic interneurons.     We show that developmental transitions are accompanied by loss of bivalency at many promoters in line with their increasing developmental restriction from pluripotent ESC through multipotent NSC to committed GABAergic interneuron.     At the NSC stage, the promoters of genes encoding many transcriptional regulators required for differentiation of multiple neuronal subtypes and neural crest appear to be bivalent, consistent with the broad developmental potential of NSCs. Upon differentiation to GABAergic neurons, all non-GABAergic promoters resolve to H3K27me3 monovalency, whereas GABAergic promoters resolve to H3K4me3 monovalency or retain bivalency.     Importantly, many of these epigenetic changes occur prior to any corresponding changes in gene expression.     Intriguingly, another group of gene promoters gain bivalency as NSCs differentiate toward neurons, the majority of which are associated with functions connected with maturation and establishment and maintenance of connectivity.     These data show that bivalency provides a dynamic epigenetic signature of developmental potential in both NSCs and in early neurons.     Neural stem cells derived from mouse embryonic stem cells were differentiated into neurons and FACS purified based on RedStar fluorescence driven by the Tau promoter.     Chromatin was prepared from NSCs and neurons (n=1), sonicated to roughly 300bp and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against H3K4me3, H3K27me3, total Histone H3 and total IgG, alongside a 5% input sample.     K4/K27 and corresponding input samples were analysed by ChIPSeq
 E-GEOD-27027 - Expression profiling of mammary stem cell enriched fractions and other fractions from fetal and adult mouse. Examination of genome-wide, gene expression level differences among adult and fetal mammary sub-populations including fetal CD24high cells and adult CD49fhighCD24medium cells which harbor enriched mammary stem cell activity.     A genome wide 12-plex expression array using linear-amplified (Eberwine) mRNA from dissociated and FACS sorted  fetal and adult mammary gland populations.     Samples represent independent pooled biological replicates.
 E-GEOD-21180 - Characterization of the single-cell transcriptional landscape by highly multiplex RNA-Seq Our understanding of the development and maintenance of tissues has been greatly aided by large-scale gene expression analysis.     However, tissues are invariably complex, and expression analysis of a tissue confounds the true expression patterns of its constitutent cell types.     Here we propose a novel strategy to access such complex samples.     Hundreds of single-cell RNA-Seq expression profiles were generated, and clustered to form a two-dimensional cell map onto which expression data was projected.     The resulting cell map integrates three levels of organization: the whole population of cells, the functionally distinct subpopulations it contains, and the single cells themselves—all without need for known markers to classify cell types.     The feasibility of the strategy is demonstrated by analyzing the complete transcriptomes of 436 single cells of three distinct types.     We believe this strategy will enable the unbiased discovery and analysis of naturally occurring cell types during development, adult physiology and disease.     Comparison of single-cell mRNA expression in 436 single cells from three cell types
 E-NCMF-29 - Transcription profiling of mouseWT vs CD137L-/- GC B cells WT and CD137L-/- mice of 8-12 weeks old were immunized intra-peritoneally with 50 µg chicken gamma- globulin conjugated to 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl (NP-CG) in alum or infected intranasally with 25 hemagglutinin units of influenza virus strain A/NT/60/68 in 50 µl HBSS. Nine days after immunization or infection, B cells were enriched from pooled spleens and lymph nodes of 4 mice per test group by means of magnetic labelled bead cell separation (MACS) using anti-mouse BD ImagTM CD45R/B220-particles DM. The B220+ MACS-sorted populations were stained with anti-GL7-FITC and anti-CD19-PE to sort CD19+GL7+ GC and CD19+GL7- non-GC B lymphocytes by flow cytometry on a FACSAria (BD). Around 1 million cells of each sample were obtained.     These cells were spun down and the pellet was frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80 ºC before RNA extraction.
 E-GEOD-19012 - Hif1α down-regulation is associated with transposition of great arteries in mice treated with a RA antagonist Aims: Congenital heart defect (CHD) account for 25% of all human congenital abnormalities.     Very few CHD-causing genes have been identified so far; so, to discover further genes we performed a global transcriptome analysis in mouse models of CHD. Methods and results: By the use of a retinoic acid competitive antagonist (BMS-189453) we caused CHD, thymic abnormalities and neural tube defects in mouse newborns.     Transposition of great arteries was the prevalent cardiac defect observed (61%). Recently we were able to partially rescue this abnormal phenotype by oral administration of folic acid.     Now we have performed a microarray analysis in mouse embryos (8.5 dpc) treated with BMS-189453 alone and with BMS-189453 plus folic acid (FA). On the basis of microarray and QRT-PCR results, we deeper analysed Hif1α because of its down-regulation in BMS-treated embryos vs WT and its increased expression level in BMS+FA treated embryos compared to BMS-treated ones.     Immunofluorescence experiments confirmed the under-expression of Hif1α protein in BMS-treated embryos compared to WT and BMS+FA treated ones and moreover demonstrated that at 8.5 dpc Hif1α is mainly expressed in the embryo’s heart.     Conclusion: We propose that Hif1α down-regulation by blocking retinoic acid binding, may contribute to the development of the cardiac defects of mouse newborns.     In line with our hypothesis, when Hif1α expression level is restored (by supplementation of folic acid) a decrement of CHD is found.     At the best of our knowledge this is the first report that link retinoic acid metabolism to Hif1α regulation and the development of TGA 2 samples w/ 2 dye-swaps
 E-GEOD-25080 - Genes regulated by HoxA3 in endothelial and hematopoietic progenitors We used a murine ES cell line in which HoxA3 expression is under control of a tetracycline-responsive element and differentiated these cells as embryoid bodies (EBs). Endothelial (Flk-1 VE-cadherin double positive, FV) and hematopoieitc progenitors (c-Kit CD41 double positive, K41) were isolated from differentiated EBs that had been induced for 6 hours by doxycycline (Dox) treatment.     Here we show genes regulated upon HoxA3 upregulation (6 hours doxycycline treatment) in hematopoietic and endothelial progenitors.
 E-GEOD-65236 - Plasma profiling of miRNAs in mouse model of osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma (OS) is the primary bone tumor in children and young adults.      Currently, there are no reliable, non-invasive biological markers to detect the presence or progression of disease, assess therapy response, or provide upfront prognostic insights.     Using a qPCR-based platform that analyzes more than 750 miRNAs, we analyzed control and diseased-associated plasma from a genetically engineered mouse model of OS to identify a profile of four plasma miRNAs. Plasma from mice with OS were profiled for miRNAs and compared with the profile of plasma from disease-free mice
 E-MEXP-506 - Transcription profiling to ompare the effects of Vitamin D3 treatment of mouse bone marrow derived dendritic cells with control, untreated cells, and additional effects of maturation of either treated or control cells with LPS This experiment is designed to compare the effects of Vitamin D3 treatment of mouse bone marrow derived dendritic cells with control, untreated cells, and additional effects of maturation of either treated or control cells with LPS.
 E-GEOD-31953 - Profiling pancreatic islets from obese db/db and lean control db/+ mice This program addresses the molecular basis of beta-cell failure associated with the development of type 2 diabetes in the db/db mice.     Specifically, which genes are differentially expressed in pancreatic islets of the db/db mice compared to the control db/+ mice? The db/db mice islets profiling data was analyzed by identifying genes that were up- and down-regulated at selected p value and fold change in the islets of db/db mice compared to the corresponding db/+ controls.
 E-GEOD-18295 - Comparison of Invasive TAM sub-population to General TAM population The tumor microenvironment modifies the malignancy of tumors.     In solid tumors this environment is populated by many macrophages (tumor-associated macrophages; TAMs) that in genetic studies that depleted these cells from mouse models of breast cancer were shown to promote tumor progression to malignancy and increase metastatic potential.     Mechanistic studies showed that these effects are through the stimulation of tumor cell migration, invasion, intravasation as well as an enhancement of angiogenesis.     Using an in vivo invasion assay it was demonstrated that invasive carcinoma cells are a unique sub-population of tumor cells whose invasion and chemotaxis is dependent upon the co-migration of TAMs with obligate reciprocal signaling through an EGF/CSF-1 paracrine loop.     In this study these invasion-promoting macrophages were isolated and subjected to analysis of their transcriptome in comparison to TAMs isolated indiscriminately to function using established macrophage markers by flow cytometry.     Five biological replicates for each population (Invasive and General TAM) were used.
 E-GEOD-6447 - Diet and phenobarbital affect cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism High cholesterol diet and xenobiotic treatment induce changes in cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism.     Mice were either 7 days on high cholesterol diet or were treated with phenobarbital.     Liver samples were analyzed using Sterolgene v0 cDNA microarrays.     Sterolgene microarray is a tool designed to enable focused studies of cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism.     We show that one week of cholesterol diet down-regulates cholesterol biosynthesis and up-regulates xenobiotic metabolism (Cyp3 family). Phenobarbital treatment also up-regulates xenobiotic metabolism (Cyp2b and Cyp3a families). We can conclude that the Sterolgene series of cDNA microarrays represent novel original tool, enabling focused and cost-wise studies of cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism.      Keywords: Treatment and diet effects One group of mice was treated i.p. with 50 mg/kg of phenobarbital in vehicle (5% DMSO in corn oil). Untreated group was injected vehicle.     Third group was 7 days on 1 % (w/w) cholesterol diet prior vehicle treatment.     After 10 h animals were sacrificed and livers were stored.     Pools of total RNA from two animals were mixed.     Three pools of untreated and phenobarbital treated groups, and two pools of cholesterol diet group were co-hybridized with liver reference on Sterolgene v0 cDNA microarray.     No dye-swaps were performed.
 E-GEOD-18056 - The Key Role of Segmented Filamentous Bacteria in the Coordinated Maturation of Gut Helper T Cell Responses Microbiota-induced cytokine responses participate in gut homeostasis, but the cytokine balance at steady-state and the role of individual bacterial species in setting the balance remain elusive.     Using gnotobiotic mouse models, we provide a systematic analysis of the role of microbiota in the induction of cytokine responses in the normal intestine.     Colonization by a whole mouse microbiota orchestrated a broad spectrum of pro-inflammatory (Th1, Th17) and regulatory T cell responses.     Unexpectedly, most tested complex microbiota and individual bacteria failed to efficiently stimulate intestinal cytokine responses.     A potent cytokine-inducing function was however associated with non-culturable host-specific species, the prototype of which was the Clostridia-related Segmented Filamentous Bacterium, and this bacterial species recapitulated the coordinated maturation of T cell responses induced by the whole mouse microbiota.     Our study demonstrates the non-redundant role of microbiota members in the regulation of gut immune homeostasis.     Germfree (GF) female 8-9-week-old mice were gavaged twice at a 24-hr interval with 0.5 mL of fresh anaerobic cultures of fecal homogenate from SFB mono-associated mice, fresh feces from Cv mice (Cvd) or from a healthy human donor (Hum). All mice were sacrificed on d8, 20 and 60 post-colonization in parallel to age-matched Cv and GF controls.     RNA was extracted from ileal tissue, and processed to biotin-labelled cRNA, and then hybridized to the NuGO array (mouse) NuGO Mm1a520177. Microarray analysis compared gene expression in ileum tissue of all the treatment groups GF, Cv, Cvd, Hum and SFB (N=3 per treatment group per time-point). Data was considered significant when P 0.05 using the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery method.
 E-GEOD-25208 - Assessment of host responses to ionizing radiation The aim of this study was to analyze the host responses to ionizing radiation by nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) bioluminescence imaging-guided transcriptomic tool.     Transgenic mice, carrying the NF-κB-driven luciferase gene, were exposed to a single dose of 8.5 Gy total-body irradiation.     In vivo imaging showed that a maximal NF-κB-dependent bioluminescent intensity was observed at 3 h after irradiation and ex vivo imaging showed that liver, intestine, and brain displayed strong NF-κB activations.     Microarray analysis of these organs showed that irradiation altered gene expression signatures in an organ-specific manner.     Pathway analysis showed that pathways associated with metabolism and immune system were altered primarily in liver and intestine.     the upregulation of fatty acid binding protein 4, serum amyloid A2, and serum amyloid A3, which are participated in both inflammation and lipid metabolism, suggesting that irradiation might affect the cross pathways of metabolism and inflammation.     Moreover, The upregulation of chemokine (CC-motif) ligand 5, chemokine (CC-motif) ligand 20, and Jagged 1 genes suggested that these genes might contribute to the radiation enteropathy.     Male transgenic mice (6 to 8 weeks old) were exposed to a single dose of whole-body X-rays generated at 6 MV (Clinac® 21EX medical linear accelerator, Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and at a dose rate of 4 Gy/min.     Mice were imaged at 0 h, 1 h, 3 h, 9 h, 24 h, 48 h, or 72 h, or on 7 d or 14 d after irradiation with 8.5 Gy. RNAs were extracted at 3 h after irradiation.
 E-GEOD-37177 - miRNA expression profiles in the serum of diabetic cats BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs negatively regulate gene expression and play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of human type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). As the domestic cat presents a spontaneous animal model for human T2DM, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether microRNAs are detectable in feline serum and whether microRNA expression profiles differ between healthy and diabetic cats.      METHODS: Total RNA was extracted from 400 µl serum of healthy lean (HL) and newly diagnosed diabetic (D) cats.     MicroRNA microarrays representing 1079 distinct mouse miRNA targets were used to measure miRNA expression in samples from eight HL and eight D cats.      RESULTS: By microarray, 227 distinct microRNAs were identified.     Nineteen miRNAs were differentially expressed in diabetic cats, but only two reached statistical significance after correction for multiple comparisons.     In qRT-PCR, miR-122  was found to be upregulated in diabetic cats more than 40-fold compared to HL cats, while miR-193b was upregulated about 10-fold.     MiR-483  showed a 6- fold increase in diabetic cats compared to HL  cats.      CONCLUSIONS: Small volumes of serum samples yield sufficient material to detect altered microRNA expression profiles in diabetic cats.     The domestic cat may be considered a useful animal model for studying miRNAs involved in human T2DM. Blood was drawn from two groups of cats: 8 healthy cats and 8 cats suffering from diabetes.     After clotting, samples were centrifuged and total mRNA was extracted from serum.     These 16 serum samples were analyzed and the groups were compared.     Due to technical problems during hybridization (leaking chamber), sample 1 4 B (Serum diabetic 8) was not included into analysis.
 E-CBIL-13 - Transcription profiling of Foxa2 knock-outs in mice to better define the role of this gene in glucose homeostasis Study to further characterize the genetic and functional consequence of the beta cell-specific ablation of Foxa2 (hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 beta, HNF-3b) in mice to better define the role of this gene in glucose homeostasis.     The study involved 8 two-channel assays on UPenn Mouse PancChip 4.0, each consisting of a competitive mutant vs control hybridization.     4 control and 4 Foxa2loxP/loxP;Ins.CRE RNA samples were hybridized to the array using a dye-swap design.     (The results from one of these assays had to be discarded from the analyses, so 7 assays were used.)
 E-GEOD-1909 - Hypoxic pulmonary hypertension study These microarray studies were performed using whole lungs of BALB/C mice during development of hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension (days 1-21) and resolution of pulmonary hypertension after return to normoxia (days 22-35) .  Mice were sampled during nine time-points and each time-point was replicated 4 times (with dye swapping). Keywords = hypoxia Keywords = pulmonary hypertension
 E-GEOD-44433 - Expression data from laser microdissected murine intestinal epithelial cells Microarray  analyses of laser microdissected murine intestinal epithelial cells under the control of maternal inflammation at 17.5 days post conception demonstrates that maternal inflammation differentially regulates 2174 (iWT) and 3345 (iARE) genes in fetal tissue, but these transcriptional profiles  were overwritten in the postnatal environment dominated by tissue inflammation at 8 weeks postnatal.     We isolated 50 ng total RNA out of laser microdissected fetal and adult intestinal epithelial cells from the distal ileum and performed microarrays to address whether maternal inflammation programs the fetal intestine towards TNF-driven pathology Conventionally raised heterozygous TnfΔARE/+ and Tnf+/+ wild type mice on C57BL/6 background were used for this study.     Female Tnf+/+ wild type (WT) mice were bred with male TnfΔARE/+ (ARE) mice and vice versa, generating offspring from healthy WT dams (WT and ARE) and inflamed ARE dams (iWT and iARE). On day 17.5 post conception (dpc) and 8 weeks postnatal the fetuses and offspring were sacrificed.The gut was freshly frozen in  Optimal Cutting Temperature (O.C.T.) embedding compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, USA) on dry ice and stored at -80°C until laser microdissection.
 E-GEOD-5805 - A high resolution map of segmental DNA copy number variation in the mouse genome Submicroscopic (  2 Mb) segmental DNA copy number changes are a recently recognized source of genetic variability between individuals.      The biological consequences of copy number variants (CNVs) are largely undefined.      CNVs have been detected in diverse species, including mice and humans.      Published studies in mice have been limited by resolution and strain selection.      We chose to study twenty-one well-characterized inbred mouse strains that are the focus of an international effort to measure, catalog, and disseminate phenotype data.      We performed comparative genomic hybridization using long oligomer arrays (oligo-aCGH) to characterize CNVs in these strains.     This technique increased the resolution of CNV detection by more than an order of magnitude over previous methodologies.      The CNVs range in size from 21-2,002 kb.  Clustering strains by CNV profile recapitulates aspects of the known ancestry of these strains.      Most of the CNVs (77.5%) contain annotated genes.      We demonstrate that this technique can identify copy number differences associated with known polymorphic traits.      The phenotype of previously uncharacterized strains can be predicted based on their copy number at these loci.      Annotation of CNVs in the mouse genome combined with sequence-based analysis provides an important resource that will help define the genetic basis of complex traits.     21 strains of mouse were assayed for copy number changes.      Seven strains were assayed at least twice.      DNA was extracted from tail for all strains.      For two strains spleen DNA was also assayed on separate chips.      C57BL/6 was used as the reference sample in all experiments.
 E-GEOD-47698 - Acyclic nucleoside phosphonates: a study on cytochrome P450 gene expression Focused on the cytochromes P450 (CYPs), we studied gene expression changes in mice treated with acyclic nucleoside antivirals adefovir and tenofovir.     Positive control group was treated by prototypic CYP inducers phenobarbital and beta-naphthoflavone.     Expression profiling with Steroltalk cDNA arrays revealed major changes in CYP mRNA expression in the inducers-treated group but only minor changes in CYP expression in the adefovir and tenofovir groups.     3 groups representing treatments with adefovir, tenofovir and phenobarbital + beta-naphthoflavone.     4-5 animals in each group + a dye swap.     Pooled samples from 10 animals treated with saline was used as a reference.     Daily application of antivirals for three days, samples were collected after 24 hours from the last treatment.

 E-NCMF-5 - Transcription profiling of Brca1- and p53-deficient mouse mammary tumors to treatment with doxorubicin, docetaxel or cisplatin We have studied in vivo responses of spontaneous Brca1- and p53-deficient mouse mammary tumors to treatment with doxorubicin, docetaxel or cisplatin.
 E-GEOD-1803 - Prion infected ScN2a and GT1 A comparison of prion infected and non-infected samples from neuroblastoma cells (N2a), and a comparison of prion infected and non-infected samples from hypothalmus cells (GT1). 11 dual-color DNA-chip hybridizations of cDNAs were made.     Keywords: other
 E-GEOD-16379 - CHO cells with enhanced and abolished gamma-secretase activity γ-secretase is an intra-membrane-cleaving aspartyl protease implicated in the processing of a wide range of type I membrane proteins including the Notch receptor and the amyloid-β precursor protein (APP). It thus regulates a diverse array of cellular and biological processes including the differentiation of neuronal embryonic stem cells, or intestinal stem cells, with the latter controlling the self-renewing of the intestinal epithelium.     Indeed, proteolysis of these proteins by  γ-secretase triggers signaling cascades by releasing intracellular domains (ICDs) which, following association with adaptor proteins and nuclear translocation, modulate the transcription of different genes by binding directly to their promoters.     The pronounced proliferative and regenerative effects of Notch signaling and its implication in the generation of the Aβ-peptides, makes  γ-secretase a therapeutic target for several types of cancer and for Alzheimer’s disease.     To investigate the broad effects of γ-secretase activity onto the cellular transcriptome, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with enhanced γ-secretase were compared to cells with abolished γ-secretase activity via a microarray designed for a genetically close species, mouse.     Our findings will potentially help to decipher the biology of γ-secretase, including a better understanding of the roles of this enzyme in gene transcription.     We compared the transcriptomes of two CHO cell lines displaying extreme differences in γ-secretase activity.     The S-1 cell line overexpressed the four components of γ-secretase (NCT, APH1aL, PS1, and PEN2) and was characterized by a marked increase in the level of PS1 heterodimers associated with 8-fold increased γ-secretase activity compared to untransfected controls.     The other cell line consisted of wild type CHO cells incubated with DAPT, a well-known γ-secretase inhibitor.     The two cell lines were used in combination with a mouse microarray to analyze gene transcription under enhanced γ-secretase.     Two samples, S1 and DAPT treated CHO- were used in biological triplicates each.
 E-GEOD-13336 - Gene expression profiling in cardiac AngII-overexpressing mice (TG1306/1R) Agonist-induced cardiac hypertrophy in TG1306/1R transgenic mice with cardiac angiotensin II overproduction leads to a gradual transition from a compensatory hypertrophic state to heart failure.     To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that play a role in maintaining cardiac integrity in the diseased heart, we performed a comparative study of gene expression between wild-type (WT) and transgenic (TG) hearts using microarray analysis.     TG1306/1R transgenics were separated into two phenotypic groups (hypertrophic and dilated) based on morphological parameters (cardiac weight index and histology) and either a moderate (hypertrophic) or a high (dilated) upregulation of molecular markers for hypertrophy and failure, and compared to age and sex-matched wild-types.     In this series, twelve 60 week old male TG1306/1R mice were separated into 3 groups:  WT1-4= Four Wild-types TG1306/1R littermates genetically negative for the transgene (-/-)  Hyp1-4= Four TG1306/1R mice heterozygote for the transgene (-/+) and developing a concentric hypertrophic phenotype   Dil1-4 = Four TG1306/1R mice heterozygote for the transgene (-/+) and developing a dilated cardiac phenotype   This series contains 4 biological replicates for the following triangulation: WT is compared to Hyp, WT is compared to Dil, and Hyp is compared to Dil.

 E-GEOD-8552 - Transcriptome of soleus muscle of 129/SV mice 1 year-old male 129/SV mice.     Animals were acclimatized to housing in single cages for one week.     Soleus muscle was harvested, total RNA isolated and subjected to transcript profiling with custom microarrays with custom-designed ATLASTM cDNA nylon filter as described (Dapp, C., Schmutz, S., Hoppeler, H. & Fluck, M. (2004) Physiol Genomics 20, 97-107).  Keywords: Transcriptome Seven replicas
 E-GEOD-35934 - Genipin inhibits LPS-induced acute systemic inflammation in mice Genipin is a natural blue colorant in food industry.     Inflammation is correlated with human disorders, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is the critical molecule involved in inflammation.     In this study, the anti-inflammatory effect of genipin on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute systemic inflammation in mice was evaluated by NF-κB bioluminescence-guided transcriptomic analysis.     Transgenic mice carrying the NF-κB-driven luciferase genes were administered intraperitoneally with LPS and various amounts of genipin.     Bioluminescent imaging showed that genipin significantly suppressed LPS-induced NF-κB-dependent luminescence in vivo.     The suppression of LPS-induced acute inflammation by genipin was further evidenced by the reductions of cytokine levels in sera and organs.     Microarray analysis of these organs showed that the transcripts of 79 genes were differentially expressed in both LPS and LPS/genipin groups, and one third of these genes belonged to chemokine ligand, chemokine receptor, and interferon (IFN)-induced protein genes.     Moreover, network analysis showed that NF-κB played a critical role in the regulation of genipin-affected gene expression.     In conclusion, we newly identified that genipin exhibited anti-inflammatory effects in a model of LPSinduced acute systemic inflammation via downregulation of chemokine ligand, chemokine receptor, and IFN-induced protein productions.     A total of 25 transgenic mice (female, 6 to 8 weeks old) were randomly divided into five groups of five mice: (1) mock, no treatment; (2) LPS (4 mg/kg), (3) LPS plus genipin (1 mg/kg), (4) LPS plus genipin (10 mg/kg), and (5) LPS plus genipin (100 mg/kg). Mice were challenged intraperitoneally with LPS and then with genipin 10 min later.     Four hours later, mice were imaged for the luciferase activity, and subsequently sacrificed for ex vivo imaging, RNA extraction, and immunohistochemical staining.
 E-MNIA-69 - Transcription profiling of E12.5 mouse whole embryos and placentas pooled within 3 litters to validate a new array E12.5 mouse whole embryos and placentas were pooled within 3 litters and total RNA was extracted.     Fluorescently-labeled, linearly-amplified cRNA targets were prepared from the RNA samples and compared on a novel microarray design to validate the system.     A "dye-swapped" experimental design was used to assess the accuracy and precision of the system.     The in situ-synthesized 60-mer oligonucleotide microarray platform contains approximately 22,000 DNA features, and was designed to detect transcripts from the entire NIA cDNA clone collection.
 E-MTAB-3170 - Analysis of splicing changes in motoneurons from mice of a severe model for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Motoneuron cell bodies were isolated by laser capture microdissection from severe SMA mice at postnatal day 3. The comparison was between heterozygote carriers, SMA disease mice and SMA mice rescued by a U7 snRNA correcting the splicing of human SMN2.
 E-GEOD-44103 - Cardiac gene expression profiling of neonatal Salvador mutant mice In this study, we identified a number of genes whose expression are regulated by the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway.     To disrupt Hippo signaling in the mouse heart, we inactivated the single mammalian Salv ortholog using a Salv conditional null allele and the Nkx2.5 cre allele that directs cardiac cre activity.     Total RNA from P8-stage hearts were used for expression profiling.     Genes transcriptionally regulated by the Hippo pathway during cardiogenesis were identifed through expression profiling in Salvador mutant (Salv CKO) neontate hearts.     Total RNA from postnatal day 8 (P8)-stage hearts was purified to generate biological replicate samples (2 control and 2 Salv CKO) and generate expression profiles.     3 technical replicates were used for each sample.
 E-GEOD-34769 - Rho kinase paralog regulation of gene transcription The serine/threonine protein kinase paralogs ROCK1 & 2 have been implicated as essential modulators of angiogenesis; however their paralog-specific roles in endothelial function are unknown.      Microarray analysis of ROCK knockdown lines revealed overlapping and unique control of global transcription by the paralogs, and a reduction in the transcriptional regulation of just under 50% of VEGF responsive genes.     MS1 mouse endothelial cells were stably transfected with non-targeting, ROCK1 specific, or ROCK2 specific shRNA plasmids.      Cells were grown to confluence and treated with sham or 2.5 ng/ml human recombinant vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for 12 hours.      RNA from six independent biological replicates from each engineered cell line were collected, pooled, and subjected to triplicate technical replicates of microarray analysis.
 E-GEOD-7119 - Gene expression profile of a murin neuroblastoma cell line infected with the prion strain 22L The underlying pathogenic mechanisms of prion infection are not well characterized.     To study the effect of prion infection on gene expression in neuronal cell cultures, a neuroblastoma (N2a) cell clone was infected with either the mouse adapted prion strain 22L or exposed to uninfected brain homogenate as a negative control.     Large scale expression analysis was performed using a cDNA microarray chip comprising about 21,000 spotted ESTs. Over hundred genes were identified that are differentially expressed in 22L-infected cells when compared to uninfected cells.     Several of the identified changes in gene expression have also been reported for other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer`s disease.      Keywords: cDNA arrays, prion, N2a, neuroblastoma cell line, murine A neuroblastoma (N2a) cell clone was infected with either the mouse adapted prion strain 22L or exposed to uninfected brain homogenate as a negative control.     Eight replicates including four dye swap experiments have been performed for the comparison of prion infected cells versus control cells.
 E-GEOD-21896 - Gene expression in LSK cells of C57B/L6, DBA/2J, B.D(Chr5), & D.B(Chr5) mice These mouse strains differ in absolute numbers of hematopoietic stem cells but differ genetically only at the Chr 5 congenic locus.     We used microarray analysis to identify candidate regulators of hematopoietic stem cells based on differential gene expression patterns.     Triplicate RNA samples, except for duplicate DBA/2J samples,  were isolated from 80,00-137,000 LSK cells from each strain.     Each of the 11 samples were analyzed on individual microarrays on two Illumina Sentrix-Mouse 6 Whole Genome Expression Beadhips.
 E-MNIA-73 - Transcription profiling of mouse embryonic stem vs trophoblastic stem cells We attempted to identify candidate genes that are expressed more highly in the ICM than in TE cells.     Mouse ES cells are cultured from the ICM, whereas mouse TS cells are cultured from the TE. Although these cells have been cultured in vitro, they represent the in vitro equivalents of the ICM and TE. Therefore, genes which are expressed more highly in ES than TS in microarray studies were good candidates for genes predominantly expressed in the ICM in blastocysts.
 E-CBIL-5 - Transcription profiling of mouse islet growth after partial pancreatectomy and exendin-4 Treatment Diabetes mellitus results from an inadequately functioning beta-cell mass.      In the adult pancreas, beta-cell mass is dynamic, increasing to meet metabolic demands and decreasing with metabolic or injury insults.     Exendin-4 (Ex-4) is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist that augments beta-cell mass by increasing beta-cell neogenesis and proliferation and by reducing apoptosis.     We utilized a cDNA microarray approach to identify genes that are differentially regulated during islet growth after Ex-4 treatment or a partial pancreatectomy (Ppx). Mice underwent 50% Ppx or sham operation and received Ex-4 or vehicle every 24 hours.     cDNA prepared from total pancreatic RNA isolated at 12, 24 and 48 hrs after surgery was hybridized to the PancChip 4.0 microarray.

Animals were acclimatized to housing in single cages for one week followed by 7 days of hindlimb suspension and one day of reloading.     Soleus muscle was harvested, total RNA isolated and subjected to transcript profiling with custom microarrays with custom-designed ATLASTM cDNA nylon filter as described (Dapp, C., Schmutz, S., Hoppeler, H. & Fluck, M.

 E-GEOD-26107 - New targets of TEAD1 revealed by ChIP-on-chip TEAD1 acts as a key molecule of muscle development, and trans-activates multiple target genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation pathways.     However, its target genes in skeletal muscles, regulatory mechanisms and networks are unknown.     Here, we use ChIP-on-chip to identify direct target genes of TEAD1. All animal procedures were performed according to protocols approved by Hubei Province, P. R. China for Biological Studies Animal Care and Use Committee.     Skeletal muscle tissues were collected from three adult Kunming mice.
 E-GEOD-12489 - Effect of phenobarbital on CAR and PXR regulated genes involved in drug metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis The nuclear receptors CAR (constitutive androstane receptor) and PXR (pregnane X receptor) mediate the effects of  phenobarbital (PB) on gene transcription.     To investigate the relative role of CAR and PXR in the induction response, cDNA arrays were generated containing 120 genes which are known to be regulated with these or related nuclear receptors (genes involved in drug metabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis, sterol synthesis/transport, heme synthesis). Samples from livers of wild type and CAR-/-, PXR-/- or CAR/PXR-/- knockout mice were tested after treatment with PB for gene expression within the  European Framework V program “Steroltalk” (www.steroltalk.net). Results from these experiments unexpectedly revealed that if CAR and PXR are deleted, PB increases the expression of several other nuclear receptors and genes involved in drug metabolism and cholesterol biosynthesis.      Animals were injected i.p. 100mg/kg phenobarbital or vehicle (5% DMSO in corn oil). After 12h they were sacrificed and total RNA was isolated from the livers.     Pools of untreated samples were mixed in each genetic variant group (wild type and CAR-/-, PXR-/- or CAR/PXR-/-) with the phenobarbital treated ones and hybridized to Sterolgene V1 arrays.
 E-GEOD-14424 - Age-Dependent Differences in Gene Expression in Response to Calvarial Injury Children less than 2 years of age are capable of healing large calvarial defects, whereas adults have been found to lack this endogenous ability.     In this study, we used microarray analysis to compare genomewide expression patterns during active regeneration after injury with calvaria in skeletally immature and mature mice.     Parietal bone defects were created in 6-day-old (juvenile) and 60-day-old (adult) mice using a 4-mm trephine bit (n = 20 mice per age group). The calvarial disc was removed, leaving the underlying dura mater intact.     Two weeks after injury, the region of regeneration with the underlying dura mater was harvested, and RNA was extracted for microarray analysis.     The 25 most differentially upregulated genes in juvenile regenerates compared with adults were listed, as well as selected bone-related genes.     In addition, QRT-PCR confirmation of specific genes was performed for validation.     Juvenile regenerates expressed significantly greater amounts of BMP-2, -4, -7, as well as FGF-2 and its receptor FGFR-1. Various other growth factors were also noted to be upregulated, including IGF-2 and Ptn. This corresponded with the increased expression of markers for osteogenic differentiation of Sparc and Oc. Markers of osteoclast activity, Acp5, Ctsk, and Mmp2, were noted to be greater in juvenile regenerates compared with adults.     The observation of Mmp14 upregulation, however, highlights the importance of balanced osteoclast-mediated bone resorption for ultimate healing.     The 2 most differentially regulated genes, transthyretin (Ttr) and prostaglandin D2 synthase (Ptgds), highlight the potential role of retinoic acid signaling and the prostaglandin axis on skeletal regeneration.     These findings underscore the multitude of biomolecular mechanisms at play, allowing juvenile calvaria to heal after injury.     The identification of various growth factors and cytokines involved also suggests novel therapeutic strategies for tissue-engineering purposes.

 E-GEOD-37479 - Differential microRNA Expression during Muscle Regeneration MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important in the regulation of many biological processes including muscle development.     However, little is known regarding miRNA regulation of muscle regeneration.     In mature murine tibialis anterior muscle following injury, 298 miRNAs were significantly changed during the time course of muscle regeneration including 86 that were altered greater than 10-fold as compared to uninjured muscle.     Temporal miRNA expression patterns were identified and included inflammation-related miRNAs (miR-223 and -147) that increased immediately after injury; this pattern contrasted to that of mature muscle-specific miRNAs (miR-1, -133a and -499) that were abruptly decreased following injury and then up-regulated in later regenerative events.     Another cluster of miRNAs were transiently increased in the early days of muscle regeneration.     This included miR-351, a miRNA that was also transiently expressed during myogenic progenitor cell (MPC) differentiation in vitro.     Based on computational predictions, further studies demonstrated that E2f3 was a target of miR-351 in myoblasts.     Moreover, knockdown of miR-351 expression inhibited MPC proliferation and promoted apoptosis during MPC differentiation, whereas miR-351 overexpression protected MPC from apoptosis during differentiation.     Collectively, these observations suggest that miR-351 is involved in both the maintenance of MPC proliferation and the transition of MPC into differentiated myotubes.     Thus, a novel, time-dependent sequence of molecular events during skeletal muscle regeneration has been identified, i.e., miR-351 inhibits E2f3 expression, a key regulator of cell cycle progression and proliferation, and promotes MPC proliferation and protects early differentiating MPC from apoptosis, important events in the hostile tissue environment after acute muscle injury.     Skeletal muscles are damaged and repaired repeatedly throughout life.     Muscle regeneration maintains locomotor function during aging and delays the appearance of clinical symptoms in neuromuscular diseases, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy.     The capacity for skeletal muscle growth and regeneration is conferred by satellite cells located between the basal lamina and the sarcolemma of mature myofibers.     Upon injury, satellite cells reenter the cell cycle, proliferate, and then exit the cell cycle either to renew the quiescent satellite cell pool or to differentiate into mature myofibers.     Despite recent advances, genes involved in these processes are still largely unknown.     Understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate satellite cell activities could promote development of novel countermeasures to enhance muscle regeneration that is compromised by diseases or aging.     Using a muscle injury mouse model, we profiled miRNA expression during muscle regeneration.
 E-GEOD-81645 - Using Mass Cytometry and In vivo Imaging to Study Emergency Repopulation of Immune Cells in Murine Liver Macrophages and dendritic cells are phagocytes present in almost all tissues in mammals and play a pivotal role for tissue homeostasis and during immune responses.     Liver phagocytes play a pivotal role in host immune responses and exquisite mechanisms are necessary to govern the density and the location of the different hepatic leukocytes.     However in catastrophic events including trauma, infections or toxin ingestion, many of the liver phagocytes can be wiped out leaving large areas devoid of these cells.     Here we used a unique combination of mass cytometry (CyTOF), gene expression and liver intravital approaches to precisely determine phagocytic populations within the liver and the functional consequences of their replenishment by myeloid precursors.     While Kupffer cells were exclusively located in the sinusoidal lumen, we identified a population of dendritic cells that was mainly located under the liver capsule.     After full depletion of dendritic and Kupffer cells, intravascular myeloid precursors replenished location, density and function of both populations.     However, these emergency repopulated livers were dysfunctional in their ability to respond to injury and to clear bacteria for at least 30 days.     After this “educational period”, new phagocytes returned to normal response to injury and bacterial trapping.     Conclusions: Our data shed light on the liver’s ability to locally shape phagocyte precursors into two vastly different immune cells localized to two fundamentally different tissue compartments.     4 different cell types were isolated from mice, RNA was extracted, and gene expression was measured using the Nanostring nCounter Mouse Immunology Panel
 E-GEOD-73124 - Genome wide profiling of the RNAPII, γH2AX, H3K4Me1, H3K4M2 and H3K4Me3 in MLL2 F/F and FC/FC MEF cells We investigated the RNAPII and γH2AX occupancy genome wide by ChIP-Seq in MLL2 F/F and FC/FC80 MEF cells.     We found that a week after MLL2 excision (FC/FC cells), a group of genes present higher levels of γH2AX and RNAPII near the TSS, as compared to the control (F/F cells).  H3K4Me1, H3K4M2 and H3K4Me3 levels near the TSS were also studied.     There is a total of 52 samples.     3 independent replicates for each experiment were performed.     H3, H2AX and IgG ChIPs were used for normalisation or as controls.The experiments were performed using immortalised mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) in which both MLL2 alleles were targeted by the loxp system (F/F cells). Tamoxifen treatment of the F/F cells for 24 hours results in the excision of both MLL2 alleles (FC/FC cells).
 E-GEOD-39638 - Genome-wide maps of 5hmC/5mC state in pluripotent and (T-)iPS induction cells. We performed 5hmC/5mC DNA Immunoprecipitation followed high-throughput sequencing using the cell sample along the whole TSKM secondary reprogramming system.     The TSKM 0D is the fibroblasts deried from TSKM-iPS mouse as the starting cells of the reprogramming.The intermediate cells is 3-days induced cells which are refered as TSKM 3D cells, and the final reprogrammed cells is the iPS cells with full pluripotency driven from this secondary system.     We compared the profiling of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and 5-methylcytosine modifications in these different cell lines.     We found that:  a widespread accompanying increase of 5hmC and 5mC at TSS and ES-active regulation regions followed by 5mC-5hmC pattern switch.     Taking the advantage of the newly established TSKM secondary reprogramming system, the epigenetic remodeling and regulation mechanisms can be further investigated to advance our understanding of the epigenetic barriers and decipher the dynamic mechanism in somatic cell reprogramming.     Examination of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine/5-methylcytosine modifications in a Tet1-mediated secondary reprogramming system
 E-GEOD-17979 - Benzo(a)pyrene induces similar gene expression changes in testis of DNA repair proficient and deficient male mice DNA damage induced by benzo(a)pyrene may lead to the formation of mutations and as a consequence to the development of diseases.     However, it is uncertain whether benzo(a)pyrene causes heritable mutations in male germ cells, which would increase health risks in offspring.     In a previous study, benzo(a)pyrene induced DNA damage was observed at all stages of spermatogenesis and in testis.     In addition, we observed that spermatogonial stem cells and testis rely, at least in part, on nucleotide excision repair for the removal of this damage, because removal was less efficient in Xpc-/- than in wild type mice.     Efficient removal will protect the germ cells against the formation of heritable mutations.     By using microarray technology, we investigated in this study the consequences of this difference in DNA adduct removal at the level of gene expression in testis 4 days after a single exposure to benzo(a)pyrene.     We analyzed 20 testis samples of mice divided into 4 groups (5 mice per group): C57BL/6 control mice, C57BL/6 mice exposed to B[a}P, Xpc-/- control mice, Xpc-/- mice exposed to B[a]P. We used a pool of 3 C57BL/6 control mice as a reference.
 E-GEOD-41698 - Mice Exposed in situ to Urban Air Pollution Exhibit Pulmonary Alterations in Lipid Droplet Synthesis Pathways In the present study, we investigate pulmonary transcriptional responses in mice following exposure in situ to ambient air in a heavily polluted urban environment.     Mature C57BL/CBA male mice were caged in sheds located in an urban area near two working steel mills and a major highway in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.     Control mice were housed in the same environment but received only high-efficiency particle-filtered air.     Whole lung tissues were collected from mice exposed for 3 weeks, 10 weeks or for 10 weeks followed by 6 weeks in the laboratory (16 weeks total). DNA microarrays were used to explore changes in pulmonary gene expression in mice breathing ambient air versus HEPA-filtered air.     Transcriptional profiling revealed changes in the expression of genes implicated in the lipid droplet synthesis pathway (plin, dgat2, lpl, s3-12, agpat2), antioxidants (ucp1). We postulate that exposure to particulate matter adsorbed with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons triggers lipid droplet synthesis (holding depots for lipids and malformed/excess proteins tagged for degradation) in the lungs, which act to sequester particulates adsorbed with toxic chemicals.     Increased lipid droplet synthesis could potentially lead to endogenous/stressor-induced synthesis of reactive oxygen species and activation of antioxidant mechanisms.     Further investigation into the stimulation of lipid droplet synthesis in the lung in response to air pollution is warranted in order to better understand these mechanistic changes and the resulting health implications.     Mature male C57BL/6 x CBA F1 hybrid mice were exposed to either HEPA-filtered or ambient air in Hamilton, ON, Canada.     Animals were exposed starting May 14, 2004 for 3 weeks (3wk), 10 weeks (10wk), or for 10 weeks followed by 6 weeks of recovery (16wk). Each treatment group consisted of five mice, for a total of 30 mice.     Total RNA was isolated from a random section of the whole lung using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA quality was confirmed by UV spectrophotometry and using an Agilent Bioanalyzer.     Total RNA (200 ng) from HEPA-filtered air or whole air-exposed mice and Universal Mouse Reference RNA (Stratagene) were used to synthesize double-stranded cDNA and cyanine-labelled cRNA according to the manufacturer's instructions (Agilent Linear Amplification Kits, Agilent Technologies). Biological samples were labelled with Cy5 dye while the commercially available Stratagene mouse reference RNA was labelled with Cy3 dye.     At each of the three time points, ambient air-exposed samples and HEPA-filtered samples were hybridized to Agilent microarrays.     Arrays were washed, and scanned on an Agilent G2505B scanner.     Data were acquired using the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5.3.1.

 E-GEOD-4603 - Transcription profiling of mouse mutant abcb4 (-/-) Molecular factors governing liver pathology in abcb4 (-/-) mice.     Dr. Nakken, Karl Esten, Dr. Berge, Knut E., Dr. Knut J. Labori, Ståle Nygård, Dr. Terese Haaland , professor Morten G. Ræder.     Institute for Experimental Medical Research and Department of Pathology, Ulleval University Hospital, Oslo, Norway and Institute for Medical Genetics, National Hospital, Oslo, Norway; E-mail: k.e.nakken@medisin.uio.no. Background and Aims: Abcb4 (mdr2) (-/-) mice secrete phosphatidylcholine-free bile and develop chronic cholangitis.     This study aims at identifying differentially transcribed genes that govern liver pathology during this disease.     Methods: Hepatic gene transcription was measured in  3, 6, 9 and 20 week old abcb4 (-/-) mice (FVB.129P2-abcb4tm1Bor/J) using cDNA microarrays; FVB/NJ abcb4 (+/+) mice serving as controls.     Altered gene transcriptions were verified by real-time polymerase chain reaction.     Attention focused on genes coding for chemokines and cytokines of potential pathogenic importance and on matrix housekeeping genes, growth factors and genes regulating wound healing, epithelial morphogenesis and tissue development.     Disease phenotype was characterized by histopathology scoring.     Results: Transcription of  serpina3 genes showed early downregulation.     Genes exhibiting upregulated transcription included: Cxcl10, Ccl2, Ccl20, Ctgf, Elf3, Lgals3, Mmp12, Mmp15, Spp1, Loxl2, Pdgfa, Pdgfrb, Sparc, Tgfbi, Tgfbr2. Conclusions: During early phases of chronic cholangitis in abcb4 (-/-) mice, hepatic downregulation of  serpina3 genes  and enhanced transcription of genes sustaining inflammatory processes contribute to fashioning the portal tract pathology.     Later, enhanced transcription of genes governing tissue repair consolidate the portal tract pathology.     Experiment Overall Design: A time-series where 5 male mice were sacrificed at time-points 3,6,9 and 20 weeks, both sick knockouts and healthy controls.     Including one dye-swap there were a total of 6 arrays at each time-point.
 E-GEOD-5825 - Transcription profiling of mouse uterus exposed to DES reveals altered uterine gene expression that maybe associated with neoplasia later in life Previously, we described a mouse model where the well-known reproductive carcinogen, diethylstilbestrol (DES), caused uterine adenocarcinoma following neonatal treatment.     Tumor incidence was dose-dependent reaching  90% by 18 mo. following 1000 µg/kg/day of DES.  These tumors followed the initiation/promotion model of hormonal carcinogenesis with developmental exposure as the initiator, and exposure to ovarian hormones at puberty as the promoter.     To identify molecular pathways involved in DES-initiation events, uterine gene expression profiles were examined in prepubertal mice exposed to DES (1, 10 or 1000 µg/kg/day) on days 1-5 and compared to age-matched controls.      Of more than 20,000 transcripts, approximately 3% were differentially expressed in at least one DES treatment group compared to controls; several transcripts demonstrated dose-responsiveness.     Assessment of gene ontology annotation revealed alterations in genes associated with cell growth, differentiation, and adhesion.      When expression profiles were compared to published studies of uteri from 5 day old DES-treated mice, or adult mice treated with 17β estradiol, similarities were seen suggesting persistent differential expression of estrogen responsive genes following developmental DES exposure.      Moreover, several significantly altered genes have been identified in human uterine adenocarcinomas.      Four altered genes [Lactotransferrin (Ltf), Transforming growth factor beta inducible (Tgfβ1), Cyclin D1 (Ccnd1), and Secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (Sfrp4)], selected for real time RT-PCR analysis, correlated well with the directionality of the microarray data.     These data suggest altered gene expression profiles observed two weeks after treatment ceased, were imprinted at the time of developmental exposure and maybe related to the initiation events resulting in carcinogenesis.      Experiment Overall Design: There were 3 DES doses (1, 10 and 1000 ug/kg/day) administered to neonates on days 1-5.  RNA was pooled for 10 mice, with each dose having its own matching control (corn oil).  Dye-flipped hybridizations were performed for each paired comparison.
 E-GEOD-24323 - MicroRNA analysis unravels the molecular basis of bleomycin induced lung fibrosis in mouse The molecular mechanisms of lung injury and fibrosis are incompletely understood.     microRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial biological regulators by suppression of their target genes and are involved in a variety of pathophysiologic processes.     To gain insight into miRNAs in the regulation of lung fibrosis, total RNA was isolated from lung samples harvested at different days after bleomycin treatment, and miRNA array was performed thereafter.     miRNAs expressed in lungs with bleomycin treatment at different time points were compared to miRNAs expressed in lungs without bleomycin treatment, resulting in 161 miRNAs differentially expressed.     Furthermore, miRNA expression patterns regulated in initial and late periods after bleomycin were identified.     Target genes were predicted in silico for differentially expressed miRNAs, including miR-7f, miR-7g, miR-196b, miR-16, miR-195, miR-25, miR-144, miR-351, miR-34a, miR-499, miR-704, miR-717, miR-10a, miR-211, miR-34a, miR-367 and miR-21, and then cross-referenced to molecular pathways including apoptosis, Wnt, Toll-like receptor, and TGF-β signaling, which are involved in different pathological phenotypes such as apoptosis, inflammation, and fibrosis.     Our study demonstrated relative abundance of miRNA levels in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis.     The miRNAs and their potential target genes identified herein contribute to the understanding of the complex transcriptional program of lung fibrosis.     Under anesthesia, 2.5 U/kg bleomycin dissolved in sterile PBS was administered via trachea as previously described.     Lung tissues were harvested at the time point of day 0, 3, 7, 14, and 21 post bleomycin challenges.     3 sample in specific time point, except for day 14 where nday14 = 2.

 E-GEOD-7690 - Transcription profiling of mouse CD34-enriched keratinocyte stem cells Recent developments in animal models (Morris et al., 2004; Tumbar et al., 2004) as well as the discovery of cell surface markers (Jones and Watt, 1993; Tani et al., 2000; Trempus et al., 2003; Nijhof et al., 2006) have made it possible to isolate living epidermal hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) from mouse skin, facilitating the study of the biological and molecular features inherent to HFSCs.  A complexity of stem and progenitor cell populations within the hair follicle has been revealed.     Here, we report comprehensive profiling of mouse CD34-expressing HFSCs using the Agilent mouse oligo microarray platform in order to extend and enrich the existing HFSC databases.       Experiment Overall Design: Total RNA was prepared from CD34(+) and CD34(-) keratinocytes obtained from three biological replicates, labeled with 2 different fluorescent dyes, and hybridized to the Agilent oligo-microarrays containing ~22,000 mouse genes and Expression Sequence Tag (EST) probes (supplemental methods).  The experiment contained technical dye-flips of each pairwise comparison.
 E-GEOD-10865 - Transcription profiling of mouse liver from polygenic obese line - effects of trans-10, cis-12-Conjugated linoleic acid The trans-10, cis-12-isomer of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) causes a rapid reduction of body and adipose mass in mice by decreasing adipocyte size and number.     In addition to changes in adipose tissue, numerous studies have reported alterations in hepatic lipid metabolism.     Livers of CLA fed mice gain mass due to lipid accumulation; however, the precise molecular mechanisms are unknown.     To elucidate these mechanisms, we examined fatty acid composition and gene expression profiles of livers from a polygenic obese line of mice fed 1% trans-10, cis-12 CLA. Following examination of the fatty acid profile it was concluded that stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD) activity was unaffected by CLA. Analysis of gene expression data led to the identification of 1393 genes differentially expressed in the liver of CLA fed mice at a nominal P-value of 0.01 and 775 were considered significant using a false discovery rate threshold of 0.05. Following Bonferroni correction and excluding lowly expressed transcripts, 198 genes were identified as being differentially expressed with 17 genes having ≥ 2-fold change.     Pathway analysis of the 775 genes considered significant using FDR found that 38 of these genes are controlled by Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4α, a transcription factor thought to be important in controlling liver metabolic status.     The list of significant differentially expressed genes found in the liver of mice fed CLA vs. LA is linked below as a supplementary file.     Experiment Overall Design: Functional genomic analysis of liver tissue extracted from polygenic obese male mice fed either a control (1% linoleic acid) or treatment (1% trans 10, cis 12 conjugated linoleic acid) diet after fourteen days.     Four or five mice were pooled for each labeling.     There is 1 replicate for each experiment, for a total of 4 microarrays.
 E-GEOD-14774 - Altered gene expression profiles in testis developmental exposed to endocrine disruptors Environmental reproductive health focuses on the effect of exposure to contaminants considered as endocrine disruptors.     Developmental testis is considered as target of these compounds affecting testicular functions in adults and suspected implications in tumor etiology.     Comparative analysis of gene expression in mouse testis exposed to five disruptors, three different dosages and three accumulative developmental stages shown defined signature profiles of gene deregulation for MEHP (monoethyl phthalate) and zearalenone (a phytoestrogen) and different to 17β-estradiol exposure.     The effects are even detected in postpuberal male offspring from premating exposed mothers.     Oxidative stress response, protein ubiquitination and oxidative phosphorylation are the most representative pathways affected.     Animal Exposure  CD-1 mice were in vivo exposed to several doses of EDs following a defined protocol: mothers were exposed two weeks before mating (exposure A); the same exposure and dose were maintained during pregnancy (exposure B) and four weeks after birth (exposure C). In all exposures, male offspring were sacrificed to obtain the testes.     The compounds were administrated in drinking water to a final concentration of:  E2(mg/l) BPA(mg/l) Zea(mg/l) MEHP(mg/l) Lindane(mg/l) Dose (1) 0.02 0.5 4 27.85 50 Dose (2) 0.04 50 12 139.17 100 Dose (3) 0.16 200 20 278.34  200  Ethanol was used as vehicle for E2, BPA and Zea and DMSO was for MEHP and Lindane.     Control testes were obtained from animals exposed to solvents of EDs: Ethanol and DMSO. Animal care and sacrifice were made following regulations from the CSIC Bioethics Committee.      RNA preparation  Total RNA from testes of exposed animals and controls was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s standard protocol.     RNA samples were spectrophotometrically quantified using NanoDrop (NanoDrop Technologies). To minimize the effect of inter-individual expression variability we made pools of RNA from at least 3 individual RNA samples from each experimental condition (same quantity of total RNA per sample). Pools of RNA were checked for quality performing Experion analysis (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Total RNA from testes of unexposed four weeks old animals was also extracted with the purpose of making pools to assess the variability at the expression level of the mouse strain used (Ctr).  Microarray Processing  Starting with total RNA from pools described above, full length cDNAs were synthesized from oligo(dT) primers bearing a T7 promoter.     These cDNAs were used as template for in vitro transcription by T7-RNA-Polymerase to amplify the mRNAs; following the Amino Allyl MessageAmp™ aRNA Kit (Ambion, Inc.) protocol.     The amplified mRNAs (aRNA) were labeled either with Cy3 or Cy5 dyes, using Amersham CyDye Post-Labeling Reactive Dyes (Amersham Biosciences). The incorporated dye was spectrophotometrically quantified using NanoDrop (NanoDrop Technologies). The same dye signal quantities of labeled experimental and control aRNAs were mixed and hybridized to Mouse Oligoset v3 (OPERON) arrays from Genomics facility-University of Cincinnati (USA). The slides contained 31,769 spotted probes (70 mer oligonucleotides) corresponding to 24,878 expressed or predicted mouse genes.     Hybridization and washes of microarrays were performed according to Genomics facility-University of Cincinnati instructions.     Dye-Swap replicates were performed: one slide hybridized with experimental and control targets labeled with Cy3 and Cy5, respectively; and the second slide with the same type of targets but inversely labeled.     Target refers to labeled aRNA while probe refers to the oligonucleotides spotted on the microarray platform.     Imaging and data generation were carried out using a GenePix 4000B (Axon Instruments) and associated software from Axon Instruments, Inc. The microarray slides were scanned with dual lasers with wavelength frequencies to excite Cy3 and Cy5. Images were captured in TIFF files.     Information extraction for a given spot was based on the median value for the signal pixels minus the median value for the background pixels to produce a gene set data file for all the DNA spots.     The Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence signal intensities were normalized.
 E-GEOD-30657 - Microarray analysis of Normal and MPS VII mouse aorta Mucopolysaccharidosis VII (MPS VII) is due to mutations within the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucuronidase, and results in the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans.      MPS VII causes aortic dilatation and elastin fragmentation.     In this study we performed microarray analysis of ascending aortas from normal and MPS VII mice, trying to find out possible genes responsible for the phenotype observed.     In addition, during our breeding strategy, we noticed that some MPS VII mice had less dilated aortas, and we proposed that an yet-unidentified gene could be responsible for the difference observed.     We therefore included in the analysis two MPS VII mice with aortas that were not dilated.     Total RNA extracted from ascending aortas from 3 Normal mice, 3 MPS VII mice with dilated aortas and 2 MPS VII mice with aortas that were not dilated.
 E-GEOD-30079 - Genetic toxicology and toxicogenomic analysis of 3 cigarette smoke condensates in vitro reveals few differences between high and low tar brands This experiment investigated the response of mouse pulmonary epithelial cells in culture (FE1 cell line) to 3 different brands of cigarette smoke condensate.     The three brands represent a full flavour, regular and king-size light cigarettes.     These vary in some key chemical consistuents.     Brand #1 has the highest tar content.     The cells were exposed to two doses: one at approximately 50% cytotoxicity, and the other at approximately 20%. Both doses were clastogenic.     The major pathways affected included xenobiotic metabolism, cell cycle, apoptosis, oxidative stress and inflammation.     Although brand #1 exhibited the most numbers of genes that were differentially expressed, there did not appear to be any major differences in the expression profiles between the brands.     Although some genes did not reach statistical significance, in general there was consistency in the direction of fold changes for genes across all brands.     MutaMouse FE1 cells in culture (derived from lung epithelial cells) were exposed to cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) collected from 3 brands: Brand #1 – Full Flavor; Brand #3 – Regular; Brand #5 – Light King Size.     Experiments were performed on 5 replicates per condition (i.e., n=5 per group); one replicate was removed from 4 groups later in the study.     Cells were exposed at 70% confluence in 150 mm plates to either 45 µg/ml or 90 µg/ml CSC alongside cells exposed to 1% DMSO (Sigma-Alderich, Canada) in 1:1 DMEM:F12 (without FBS). Cells were exposed to CSC for 6 hours and then either: (a) immediately harvested, or (b) washed in PBS and cultured for another 4 hours in fresh media.     The two time points were called 6 hours or 10 hours (6 hours exposure, 4 hours recovery for the latter). Cells were harvested with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and stored at -80oC. RNA was extracted and labelled, and hybridized to Agilent 22K mouse development microarrays following the manufacturer's protocol (Agilent Technologies Inc., USA). Arrays were washed and scanned on a ScanArray Express (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences), and data were acquired with ImaGene 5.5 (BioDiscovery Inc.). Biological samples were hybridized in Cy5, and Stratagene Universal Reference RNA was hybridized in Cy3.
 E-GEOD-32370 - Regulation of monocyte functional heterogeneity by miR-146a Monocytes and their lineage descendants serve as a central defense system against infection and injury but if uncontrolled can also promote an excessive pathological inflammatory response.     Therefore a current research goal is to understand how the organism controls the number and function of monocytes and how these variables can be tailored in therapy.     Considering the evidence that monocytes are heterogeneous and exist in at least two subsets committed to divergent functions, we investigated whether distinct factors regulate the balance between monocyte subset responses in vivo.     We identified a microRNA (miRNA), miR-146a, which is differentially regulated both in mouse (Ly-6Chi and Ly-6Clo) and human (CD14hi and CD14lo CD16+) monocyte subsets.     The single miRNA was found to significantly control the amplitude of the Ly-6Chi monocyte response during inflammatory challenge whereas it did not affect Ly-6Clo cells.     miR-146a–mediated regulation was cell-intrinsic and depended on Relb, a member of the non-canonical NF-κB/Rel family, which is identified here as a novel miR-146a target.     These observations provide novel mechanistic insights into the molecular events that regulate monocyte functional heterogeneity and identify therapeutic targets that can influence the quality and quantity of monocyte responses.     4 samples of splenic Ly-6Chi monocytes,  4 samples of splenic Ly-6Clo monocytes; both isolated from C57BL/6 mice.     Each sample was generated by fluorecsence activated cell sorting from the pooled spleens of 10 mice.
 E-TOXM-18 - Transcription profiling of mice liver after treatment for 2 weeks with different known carcinogens and non-carcinogens Previously we demonstrated that the mouse liver tumor response to the non-genotoxic carcinogens oxazepam [CAS:604-75-1;CHEBI:7823] and Wyeth-14,643 [CAS:50892-23-4;CHEBI:32509] involved more differences than similarities in changes in early gene expression.     In this study we used quantitative real-time PCR and oligonucleotide microarray analysis to identify genes that were up- or downregulated in mouse liver early after treatment with different known carcinogens, including oxazepam [CAS:604-75-1 CHEBI:7823] (125 and 2500 p.p.m.), o-nitrotoluene [CAS:88-72-2;CHEBI:33098] (1250 and 5000 p.p.m.) and methyleugenol [CAS:93-15-2;CHEBI:4918] (75 mg/kg/day), or the non-carcinogens p-nitrotoluene [CAS:99-99-0;CHEBI:33097] (5000 p.p.m.), eugenol [CAS:97-53-0;CHEBI:4917] (75 mg/kg/day) and acetaminophen [CAS:103-90-2;CHEBI:2386] (6000 p.p.m.). Starting at 6 weeks of age, mice were treated with the different compounds for 2 weeks in the diet, at which time the livers were collected.     First, expression of 12 genes found previously to be altered in liver after 2 weeks treatment with oxazepam and/or Wyeth-14,643 was examined in livers from the various chemical treatment groups.     These gene expression changes were confirmed for the livers from the oxazepam-treated mice in the present study, but were not good early markers for all the carcinogens in this study.     In addition, expression of 20 842 genes was assessed by oligonucleotide microarray [n ¼ 4 livers/group, 2 hybridizations/liver (with fluor reversals)] and the results were analyzed using the Rosetta Resolver System and GeneSpring software.     The analyses revealed that several cancer-related genes, including Fhit, Wwox, Tsc-22 and Gadd45b, were induced or repressed in unique patterns for specific carcinogens and not altered by the non-carcinogens.     The data indicate that even if the tumor response, including molecular alterations, is similar, such as for oxazepam and methyleugenol, early gene expression changes appear to be carcinogen specific and seem to involve apoptosis and cell cyclerelated genes.
 E-GEOD-12139 - Colonic tissues from an acute TNBS-induced colitis model in SJL mice. Experimental colitis is often used as a model for the inflammatory bowel diseases, ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.     Results identify the inflammatory processes during acute colitis in affected tissues from TNBS-treated susceptible 5-7 week old SJL mice.      Keywords: Disease state analysis Two-condition experiment, Treated vs Non-treated.     Biological replicates: 4 treated, 4 non-treated.     One replicate per array.
 E-GEOD-42504 - Timecourse of Interferon-Gamma Treatment of Bone Marrow-Derived Macrophages (BMDMs) The systematic temporal gene expression analysis of primary macrophages activated under immune (interferon-gamma (IFN-g)) and productive viral infection with murine cytomegalovirus (mCMV). The primary objective of the study is to define, in an unbiased manner, cause-and-effect relationships in the program of gene activation in this cellular system.     The even spacing and time intervals (every 30 minutes) makes this study amenable to modelling of gene networks in the system.     A kinetic analysis of IFN-g treatment on the gene expression of murine (BALB/c) bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) over the first 12 hours, sampling every 30 minutes.     Agilent mouse genome arrays were used to determine the differences in gene expression between mock and IFN-g treated.     The 25 samples collected for the mock IFN-g treatment were pooled and treated as a pooled control.     Pooled control was labelled with Cy3 dye and hybridised with every other sample (labelled with Cy5 dye) = 25 dual-dye array hybridisations.     The reference channel of the dual-channel hybridisations was only used to normalise the expression of the test channel, rather than used to calculate ratio data.     Thus, the normalised data represent log2 single-channel data.

 E-CBIL-31 - Transcription profiling of dorsal pancreas tissue from Ngn3 null mice and wild-type littermates at days 13 and 15 of embryonic development This experiment was designed to analyze the expression of genes in dorsal pancreatic cells at two temporally separated stages of pancreas development.      This was accomplished by comparing expression profiles of embryonic dorsal pancreas tissue from Ngn3 null mice with wild-type littermates at days 13 and 15 of embryonic development.     The comparison of gene expression in mutant and wild-type pancreas was used primarily to show genes that are lower expressed/missing in the mutant, as Ngn3 null mice have no endocrine pancreas tissue.     From each developmental stage, five wild-type and five mutant samples were chosen, representing embryos from at least three different litters.     Wild-type and mutant samples from the common stage of development were paired randomly and analysed in flipped colour.     Probes were spotted in duplicate on each slide in a randomised (fixed) layout, effectively distributing the duplicate spots randomly over the slide.
 E-GEOD-40062 - Gene expression profile of the stomach from an AGR2 null mouse The in vivo function of AGR2 was examined by generating an AGR2 null mouse.      The mice died prematurely due to hyperplasia and dysplasia of the glandular stomach.     Gene expression profiling was performed to compare differences in transcription between wild-type and null AGR2 mice.     Female AGR2 wild-type and knockout mice were sacrificed at the age of 26 weeks and the glandular stomachs were removed.      Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The RNA was was reverse transcribed, labeled, and hybridized to mouse oligonucleotide DNA microarrays (Illumina MouseRef-8 v2 Expression BeadChip)
 E-MEXP-23 - Transcription profiling of mouse aorta and vSMCs response to dioxin We compared the global gene expression profiles of C57BL/6 mice aortas with the profiles of cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMC) from the same mice, and determined whether gene responses to dioxin exposure in the vSMCs would be predictive of responses in the aorta.
 E-GEOD-1954 - CX43 heterozygous, Cx43 null and Cx32 null vs wildtype neonatal mouse brain Cy3-labeled cDNA from brains of neonatal C57BL Cx43 null, Cx43 heterozygous and Cx32 null mice were compared among themselves and to Cy3-labeled cDNA from brains of neonatal C57BL wildtype mice through Cy5-labeled sample reference prepared at once for the entire experiment from aorta, brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, ovary/testicles, spleen, and stomach - equal amounts from adult male and female C57BL mice.
 E-GEOD-25424 - MicroRNAs are Transported in Plasma and Delivered to Recipient Cells by High-Density Lipoproteins (microRNA signatures retrieved from rHDL injected into WT, ApoE-/- chow, ApoE-/-high fat diet) Circulating microRNAs (miRNA) are relatively stable in plasma and are a new class of disease biomarkers.     Here we present evidence that human high-density lipoprotein (HDL) transports endogenous miRNAs and delivers them to recipient cells with functional targeting capabilities.     Highly-purified fractions of human HDL contain small RNAs, and the HDL-miRNA profile from normal subjects is significantly different than familial hypercholesterolemia subjects.     miRNAs were demonstrated to associate with both native and reconstituted HDL particles, and reconstituted HDL injected into mice retrieved distinct miRNA profiles from normal and atherogenic models.     Cellular export of miRNAs to HDL was demonstrated to be regulated by neutral sphingomyelinase.     HDL-mediated delivery of miRNAs to recipient cells was demonstrated to be scavenger receptor BI-dependent.     Furthermore, HDL delivery of both exogenous and endogenous miRNAs resulted in the direct targeting of mRNA reporters.     Notably, HDL-miRNA from atherosclerotic subjects induced differential gene expression, with significant loss of conserved mRNA targets in cultured hepatocytes.     Collectively, these observations suggest that HDL participates in a novel mechanism of intercellular communication involving the transport and delivery of miRNAs. microRNA signatures retrieved from rHDL injected into WT, ApoE-/- chow, ApoE-/-high fat diet Profiled rHDL miRNA signatures from n=3 WT; n=3 ApoE-/- chow, n=4 ApoE-/- high fat mice

 E-GEOD-40183 - Novel biomarkers for distributed stem cells: asymmetric self-renewal associated (ASRA) genes identification by combined cDNA micro-array orthogonal intersection and sparse feature analysis Biomarkers unique for distributed stem cells (DSCs) have proven elusive.      Previous searches for proteins expressed specifically in DSCs were hampered by difficulty obtaining pure DSCs and challenges to successfully mining complex molecular expression data.      To identify novel candidates for DSC biomarkers, we combined a sparse feature selection method with combinatorial molecular expression data focused on asymmetric self-renewal, a defining DSC property.      Our analyses revealed reduced expression of the histone H2A variant H2A.Z as a superior discriminator for asymmetric self-renewal, which proved to be a novel pattern-specific biomarker of DSCs. Overview: Sixteen cDNA micro-array samples were analyzed, with four replicates for each of four biologically orthogonal comparisons of congruent asymmetrically self-renewing versus symmetrically self-renewing cells.     Sparse feature selection was used to identify a uniquely robust discriminator of these two different DSC self-renewal patterns.      General Approach: An orthogonal-intersection strategy for identification of asymmetric self-renewal associated genes  Previously, we used non-tumorigenic, immortalized mouse mammary epithelial C127 cells and mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) to derive lines with conditional self-renewal patterns.      The self-renewal pattern of these cells can be reversibly switched between symmetric and asymmetric by varying either culture temperature or Zn concentration, respectively, as a consequence of controlling p53 expression from respectively responsive promoters (1-6).  These and related cell lines were used to design a 2 x 4 orthogonal-intersection microarray analysis for the purpose of identifying genes whose expression consistently showed the same pattern of change between asymmetric self-renewal versus symmetric self-renewal.      Four different pair-wise comparisons were developed in which a state of asymmetric self-renewal was compared to a congruent state of symmetric self-renewal.      The first 3 comparisons were based on a difference in p53 expression, but each had a different biological context.      For asymmetric versus symmetric, respectively, these comparisons were: 1) Zn-inducible p53 MEFs (Ind-8 cells) versus p53-null control MEFs (Con-3 cells), both cultured in Zn-supplemented medium (65 micromolar ZnCl2); 2) Zn-inducible p53 MEFs in Zn-supplemented medium versus in Zn-free medium (1,3-6); and 3) low temperature (32.5˚C)-inducible p53 mouse mammary epithelial cells (MMECs; 1h-3 cells) versus vector-control MMECs (i.e., no p53 transgene; 1g-1 cells), both cultured at 32.5˚C (2,5,6).  The fourth comparison had a special purpose.      It provided a comparison of asymmetric versus symmetric self-renewal that was not due to a difference in p53 expression (1).  Two previously described derivatives of the Zn-responsive p53-inducible MEFs were used to make this comparison.      One line (tI-3 cells) is stably transfected with a constitutively expressed type II inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH II) gene (1,3,5).  IMPDH II is the rate-limiting enzyme for guanine ribonucleotide biosynthesis.      Its down-regulation by p53 is required for asymmetric self-renewal (3,5).  Therefore, even in Zn-supplemented medium, which induces normal p53 expression, cells derived with a stably expressed IMPDH II transgene continue to undergo symmetric self-renewal (3,5).  This abrogation of p53 effects on self-renewal pattern occurs even though other p53-dependent responses remain intact (3).  Under the same conditions, control vector-only transfectants (tC-2 cells) continue to exhibit asymmetric self-renewal (3,5).  Thus, this fourth comparison could be used to exclude genes whose change in expression was primarily due to changes p53 expression and not specifically transitions in self-renewal symmetry as well (1).  We identified genes whose expression varied consistently for all 4 orthogonal comparisons of cells in states of asymmetric self-renewal versus symmetric self-renewal (7).  We developed a new quality control metric called the population division cycle ratio (PDC ratio) to insure consistent degrees of asymmetric self-renewal and symmetric self-renewal across all 4 orthogonal comparisons (6,7).  Prefabricated cDNA microarrays constructed with the National Institute for Aging (NIA) mouse 15K mouse clone set were used for the analysis (8,9).  As detailed in supplemental Materials and Methods (see below), for each of the 4 experimental comparisons, we isolated two independent samples of RNA; and each of the RNA samples was labeled independently with Cy5 and Cy3 fluorescent dyes.      Each independent set of fluorescent RNA samples was used to develop two reciprocal co-hybridizations for each experimental comparison.      Thus, data from 4 microarrays, representing 2 independent experiments, were available for each of the 4 orthogonal contexts for asymmetric versus symmetric self-renewal.      Materials and Methods:  cDNA Microarray Data Analysis Cells for total RNA extraction were harvested at the time estimated for PDC = 2 (36 hours for Ind-8 and Con-3, 48 hours for tC-2, tI-3, 1h-3, and 1g-1), and were selected for microarray experiments based on the actual PDC ratio curves derived from replicate cell cultures grown in parallel.      The same PDC ratio values were maintained to obtain similar fractions of cycling stem-like cells and non-cycling differentiating cells for all compared asymmetric models.      Total RNA was extracted with the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and impurities were removed with the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).  Fifty to seventy μg of total RNA was used for cDNA syntheses.      Arabidopsis thaliana mRNAs (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were introduced as internal probe standards into reverse transcription reactions to normalize data between different arrays.     Cy3- or Cy5-fluorescently labeled cDNAs were hybridized onto the NIA 15K mouse cDNA prefabricated arrays (8), supplied by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)-BioMicro Center, using the procedure provided by the MIT-BioMicro Center.     Hybridized microarrays were scanned with the arrayWoRxeTM Biochip Reader (Applied Precision LLC, Northwest Issaquah, WA).  The fluorescence intensity of each spot was analyzed from the scanned tiff images by using the DigitalGenomeTM software (MolecularWare, Inc. Cambridge, MA).  The Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence intensities were normalized by calculating the normalization factor from total intensity normalization (10). Analyses for each self-renewal pattern comparison were performed as duplicate independent experiments.      For each comparison, we performed two chip hybridizations with reciprocally labeled Cy3 or Cy5 target cDNAs to each biological sample.     The entire analysis incorporated data from 16 independent chips.      A gene was selected for data analyses only if the mean value of foreground pixels of the spot was greater than the sum of the mean and two standard deviations of the background pixels.      For individual gene probe spots, the expression intensities of Cy5 and Cy3 channels were estimated by subtracting mean backgrounds from mean foregrounds.      The ratios of the final gene expression intensities for the asymmetrically self-renewing states to the respective symmetrically self-renewing states were calculated.      These ratio values (7) were used for sparse feature selection.      References:  1. M. Noh, J. L. Smith, Y. H. Huh, J. L. Sherley, J.

 E-GEOD-28258 - Alternative splicing changes in A. fumigatus sensitized mice Dysregulation of alternative splicing of mRNA precursors is known to  contribute to numerous human diseases.     In this study we carried out  the first systematic search for asthma-associated changes in  alternative splicing events, using a model of Aspergillus fumigatus (A.  fumigatus)-sensitized mice and an exon junction microarray to detect  potential changes in alternative splicing.     One of the  sensitization-associated changes identified in the search was a shift  in alternative splicing of the mRNA encoding cFLIP, a modulator of the  caspase- mediated extrinsic apoptosis pathway.     Expanding these studies  to human asthma patients, we discovered a significant decrease in the  expression of both cFLIP isoforms in severe corticosteroid- resistant  asthmatics.     Although it is unclear whether these changes were due  solely to differences in alternative splicing, these findings provide evidence that dysregulation of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway is part  of the underlying immunopathogenesis of severe refractory asthma.     The technical side of the microarray experiment was essentially the  Illumina protocol.

 E-GEOD-32077 - Gene responses in mouse brain to long-term exposure to microgravity The spaceflight experiment was carried out using male C57BL/10J mice (8 weeks old at launch).  Wild type mice (n=3) were launched by Space Shuttle Discovery and housed on the International Space Station (ISS) for 91 days.      They returned to the Earth by Space Shuttle Atlantis.      But only one mouse returned to the Earth alive.      Whole brain was sampled from the mouse killed by inhalation of carbon dioxide at the Life Sciences Support Facility of Kennedy Space Center within 3-4 hours after landing.      After the spaceflight experiment, the on-ground experiment was also carried out at the Advanced Biotechnology Center in Genova, Italy.      A mouse with the same species, sex, and age was housed in mice drawer system (MDS), which was utilized for the spaceflight (SF) mice, for 3 months as the ground control (GC).  Another mouse was housed in normal vivarium cage as the laboratory control (LC).  Amount of food and water supplementation and environmental conditions were simulated as the flight group.      After 3 months, brain was sampled from one mouse in group GC and LC, respectively.      Comprehensive analyses of gene expression were performed in the right brain.      Total of 4,000 genes were analyzed.      The expression levels of 60 genes significantly changed in response to SF compared with LC and/or GC.  The 15 and 16 genes were up- (  2 folds) and down-regulated (  0.5 folds), respectively, following SF vs. GC.  The levels of 58 genes were significantly altered by housing in MDS in space and/or on the ground.      Forty seven and 11 genes were significantly up- and down-regulated vs. LC.  Twenty seven out of these genes responded to caging in MDS both in space and on the ground.      Further, 31 genes were influenced by housing in MDS on the Earth.     Responses of the characteristics of brain to long-term gravitational unloading were investigated in mice.
 E-GEOD-56698 - Endothelin-1 driven proliferation of PASMC is c-fos dependent Background: Pulmonary hypertension is a rare disease characterized by pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PASMC) proliferation leading to vascularremodeling.     Multiple factors have been associated with the vessel wall thickening.     However, the responsible mechanisms are not fully understood.     Aim: In this study we aim to decipher the role ofc-fos and c-jun transcription factors in the vascular remodeling process.     Methods and Results: Expression and immunohistochemical analyses revealed high expression of c-fos and c-jun transcription factors in the vessel wall of lungs from human IPAH samples, hypoxia exposed mice and monocrotaline treated rats.     Microarray study from hypoxic lung homogenates revealed MAP kinase asthe most differentially regulated pathway.     Additionally, ET-1 and CTGF were the most up-regulated genes.     Consequently, ET-1 but not CTGF stimulation of human PASMCs increased DNA synthesis and expression of proliferative markers such as Ki67 and cell cycle regulator, cyclin D1. Moreover, ET-1 treatment elevated ERK-dependent c-fos expression and phosphorylation of c-fos and c-jun.     Silencing of c-fos with siRNA abrogated the ET-1-induced proliferation of PASMC. Conclusion: This finding shed light on the involvement of c-fos/c-jun in vascular remodeling as well as on the molecular mechanisms regulating the proliferative response of PASMCs to ET-1. 36 mice were divided into 2 groups and kept either under normoxic (Nox) or under hypoxic conditions (Hox.3h). RNA from 3 animals was pooled to get 6 pools per group.     Each pool was subjected to microarray hybridization (Nox vs. Hox.3h) in a balanced dye-swap design, giving a total of 6 dual-color hybridizations.
 E-GEOD-34479 - Cooperativity of Rb, Brca1, and p53 and malignant breast cancer evolution The dire need for more effective treatments for clinically aggressive breast cancers has motivated intensive investigations into their cellular and molecular etiology.     Breast cancers that are “triple-negative” for the clinical markers, ESR1, PGR, and HER2, typically belong to the Basal-like molecular subtype.     Defective Rb, p53, and Brca1 pathways are each associated with triple-negative and Basal-like subtypes.     Our mouse genetic studies demonstrate that concomitant inactivation of all three pathways in mammary epithelium has an additive effect on tumor latency, and predisposes highly penetrant, metastatic, adenocarcinomas.     These tumors are poorly differentiated with histologic features that are common among human Brca1-mutated tumors, including heterogeneous morphology, metaplasia, and necrosis.     Transcriptomic analyses demonstrated that the tumors shared attributes of both Basal-like and Claudin-low signatures, two molecular subtypes encompassed by the broader triple-negative category defined by clinical markers.     Ex vivo tumorsphere formation, which was suppressed by Notch and Wnt pathway inhibition, and tumor antigen profiles and are consistent with enrichment of stem-like and luminal progenitor cells among these tumors.     These studies establish a novel mouse model of malignant breast cancer based on events in the human disease and underscore the non-reciprocal requirements of three canonical tumor suppressor pathways in breast cancer evolution.     Morphogenetic pathways may provide additional avenues for targeted therapeutic intervention.     Gene expression analysis of mouse mammary tumors with perturbation of Rb family pathways, p53, and/or Brca1 are compared to other mouse model tumors (n=152)
 E-GEOD-22827 - Cell of origin influences molecular and functional properties of murine induced pluripotent stem cells Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been derived from various somatic cell populations through ectopic expression of defined factors.     It remains unclear whether iPSCs generated from different cell types are molecularly and functionally similar.     Here, we show that iPSCs obtained from fibroblasts, hematopoietic and myogenic cells exhibit distinct transcriptional and epigenetic patterns.     Moreover, we demonstrate that cellular origin influences the in vitro differentiation potentials of iPSCs into embryoid bodies (EBs) and different hematopoietic cells.     Importantly, continuous passaging of iPSCs largely attenuates these differences.     Our results suggest that low-passage iPSCs retain a transient epigenetic memory of their somatic cells of origin, which manifests as differential gene expression and  ltered differentiation capacity.     These observations might affect ongoing attempts to use iPSCs for disease modeling and also could be exploited for potential therapeutic applications to enhance differentiation into desired cell lineages.

 E-GEOD-57824 - Long non-coding RNAs and mRNAs profiles in mouse liver development Many protein-coding oncofetal genes are highly expressed in murine and human fetal liver and silenced in adult liver.     The protein products of these hepatic oncofetal genes have been used as clinical markers for the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and as therapeutic targets for HCC. Herein, we examined the expression profiles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and mRNAs found in fetal and adult liver in mice.LncRNA-mPvt1 is an oncofetal RNA that was found to promote cell proliferation, cell cycling and the expression of stem cell-like properties of murine cells.     Human lncRNA-hPVT1 promotes cell proliferation, cell cycling and the acquisition of stem cell-like properties in HCC cells by stabilizing NOP2 protein.     Regulation of the lncRNA-hPVT1/NOP2 pathway may have beneficial effects in the treatment of HCC. We collected mouse fetal livers (E12.5, E14.5, E17.5 days), neonatal murine livers and adult murine livers (8 weeks). The total RNAs recovered from these developmental livers and were used to acquire different expression profiles of mRNAs and lncRNAs.

 E-GEOD-19766 - Transcriptional responses of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - Illumina arrays These microarrays were performed for use in a genome-wide scan for LPS-regulated genes in mouse macrophages, in order to construct a list of LPS-regulated genes for detailed interrogation on custom microarrays (see GSE19490 for custom array analysis). Mouse macrophages (bone marrow-derived macrophages, BMM) were stimulated with the TLR4 agonist, lipopolysaccharide, over a time course (0, 0.5, 2, 6, 24h) and analysed in biological duplicate by commercial Illumina microarray.
 E-GEOD-3359 - Transcription profiling of mouse model for Werner syndrome Werner syndrome (WS) is a rare disorder characterized by the premature onset of a number of age-related diseases.     The gene responsible for WS is believed to be involved in different aspects of transcription, replication, and/or DNA repair.     The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) enzyme is also involved in DNA repair and is known to affect transcription of several genes.     In this study, we examined the expression profile of cells lacking the normal function of either or both enzymes.     All mutant cells exhibited altered expression of genes normally responding to oxidative stress.     Interestingly, more than 58% of misregulated genes identified in double mutant cells were not altered in cells with either the Wrn or PARP-1 mutation alone.     Consequently, the impact on gene expression profile when both Wrn and PARP-1 are mutated was greater than a simple addition of individual mutant genotype.     In addition, double mutant cultured cells showed major misregulation of genes involved in apoptosis, cell cycle control, embryonic development, metabolism, and signal transduction.     More importantly, in vivo analyses of double mutant mice have confirmed the increased apoptosis and the developmental defects in embryos as well as the major increase in intracellular phosphorylation and oxidative DNA damage in adult tissues.     They also exhibited a progressive increase in oxidative stress with age.     Thus, a major result of this study is that changes in expression of several genes and physiological functions identified in vitro were confirmed in mouse embryonic and adult tissues.     Experiment Overall Design: Microarray analyses were performed on cell cultures at the second passage (10 population doublings). For each genotype, asynchronously dividing cells derived from three healthy 15.5 day embryos from one litter were pooled at the second passage and cytoplasmic RNA was extracted.     Cytoplasmic RNA was used in these experiments to avoid contamination with heterogeneous nuclear RNA and genomic DNA. (Note that DNAse treatment was also applied to all samples). This pool of RNA was labeled sample number 1 for each genotype.     Pooling of embryonic cells was performed to minimize the effect of inter-individual biological differences.     A second pool of embryonic cells was also created from a separate dam (second litter) for each genotype (called samples number 2). This strategy allowed obtaining samples in duplicate for each genotype.     The cRNA from wild type cells were synthesized with Cy-5 labeled nucleotides and cRNAs from Wrn mutant, PARP-1 null, and PARP-1 null/Wrn mutant cells were synthesized with Cy-3 labeled nucleotides.     Hybridization was performed on Mouse Agilent 60-mer Oligo Microarray chips  by mixing wild type labeled cRNA (baseline expression levels) with either Wrn mutant, PARP-1 null, or PARP-1 null/Wrn mutant cRNA. Hybridization experiments were done in duplicates.
 E-GEOD-45876 - Mouse strain-specific responses to commensal gut bacteria at the mucosal gene expression level The host genotype has been proposed to contribute to individually composed bacterial communities in the gut.     To provide deeper insight into interactions between gut bacteria and their host, we associated germ-free C3H and C57BL/10 mice with intestinal bacteria from a C57BL/10 donor mouse.     Analysis of microbiota similarity between the experimental animals with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) 13 weeks after association revealed the development of a mouse strain specific microbiota.     Gene expression in the colonic mucosa was analyzed with a microarray approach taking advantage of a modified Affymetrix mouse genome chip.     We detected 202 genes whose expression differed significantly by a factor of   2. Application of bioinformatics tools demonstrated that functional terms including signaling/secretion, lipid degradation/catabolism, guanine nucleotide/guanylate binding and immune response were significantly enriched in differentially expressed genes.     We had a closer look at the 56 genes with expression differences of   4 and observed a higher expression in C57BL/10 mice of the genes coding for toll-like receptor 1 (4-fold) and angiogenin 4 (33-fold) which are involved in the recognition and response to gut bacteria.     In contrast, a 70-fold higher expression of the phospholipase A2, group IIA-encoding gene (Pla2g2a) was detected in C3H mice.     In addition, a number of interferon-inducible genes were higher expressed in C3H than in C57BL/10 mice including Gbp1 (18-fold), Mal (7-fold), Oasl2 (7-fold), Ifi202b (7-fold), Rtp4 (6-fold), Ly6g6c (5-fold), Ifi27l2a (5-fold), Usp18 (5-fold), Ifit1 (5-fold), Ifi44 (4-fold), and Ly6g (4-fold) indicating that these cytokines play an essential role in microbiota regulation.     However, genes coding for interferons, their receptors or factors involved in interferon signaling pathways were not differentially expressed between the two mouse strains.     Taken together, our study confirms that the host genotype is involved in the establishment of host-specific bacterial communities in the gut.     Based on expression differences after colonization with the same bacterial inoculum, we propose that Pla2g2a and interferon-dependent genes may contribute to this phenomenon.     Total RNA was extracted from the colonic mucosa  and hybridization was performed using 12.5 – 20 µg of cDNA on a customized Affymetrix nugomm 1a520177 chip.
 E-GEOD-6192 - Transcription profiling of mouse mucosal mast cell in vitro differentiation The aim of the study was to find novel genes highly upregulated in mouse mucosal mast cells.     To carry it out, differentiating progenitor cells were isolated on day4 of culturing and compared to mature mucosal mast cells obtained by day20. Experiment Overall Design: The experiment was carried out on two microarrays.     Array2 is a biological and technical replicate (dye-swap) of array1. In both cases, 3-3 samples were pooled, but of different origin.
 E-GEOD-6355 - Connexin-dependent transcellular transcriptomic networks in mouse brain Microarray experiments have generally focused on magnitude of gene expression changes in pathological conditions, thereby using the method as a high throughput screen to identify candidate marker genes and/or to validate phenotypic differences.      We have used novel strategies to extract additional information from array studies, including expression variability and coordination, from which organizational principles of transcriptomes are emerging.     We have reported that expression level, variability and coordination of numerous genes are regulated in brains of Gja1-/- mice with respect to wildtypes.     Moreover, expression coordination with Gja1 in wildtypes largely predicted expression regulation in Gja1-/- tissues.     We now report a remarkable overlap between regulations in Gja1-/- and Gjb1-/- brains, and that both differ markedly from those in Gja9-/- brain.     Since in brain these three connexins are expressed in different cell types (Gja1 in astrocytes, and ependymal and vascular cells, Gjb1 in oligodendrocytes, and Gja9 in neurons and microglia), and because astrocytes and oligodendrocytes may form syncytia coupled by gap junction channels, these observations suggest the existence of distinct connexin-dependent panglial and neuronal transcriptomic networks.     Such networks, where linkage partners are rearranged and strengths modified in brains of knockouts, may explain downstream and parallel 'ripples' of phenotypic change resulting from single gene alterations as the composition and interactions of transcription factor networks in the wildtype brain were identified and found to be altered disruption of Gja1 or Gjb1. The transcription factors also formed network hubs with genes from other functional categories, thus allowing regulation of one functional pathway through manipulation of another.     Keywords: genetic modification The brain transcriptomes of Gja9(-/-) and Gja9(+/-) P10 mice were compared to that of P10 wildtype mouse using the "multiple yellow" design in which extracts of biological replicas of the same genotype were hybridized with six 27k AECOM mouse cDNA microarrays (4 biological replicas of each genotype). These data were further compared to previously reported data on brain of neonatal wildtype, Gja1(-/-), Gja1(+/-) and Gjb1(-/-) mice (four biological replicas per genotype, reference sample design).
 E-GEOD-41903 - TRIM28 repression of retrotransposon-based enhancers is necessary to preserve transcriptional dynamics in embryonic stem cells TRIM28 (KAP1 - KRAB-associated protein 1) is critical for the silencing of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) in embryonic stem (ES) cells.     Here, we reveal that an essential impact of this process is the protection of cellular gene expression in early embryos from perturbation by cis-acting activators contained within these genetic invaders.     In TRIM28-depleted ES cells, repressive chromatin marks at ERVs are replaced by histone modifications typical of active enhancers, stimulating transcription of nearby cellular genes, notably those harboring bivalent promoters.     Correspondingly, ERV-derived sequences can repress or enhance expression from an adjacent promoter in transgenic embryos depending on their TRIM28-sensitivity in ES cells.     TRIM28-mediated control of ERVs is therefore crucial not just to prevent retrotransposition, but more broadly to safeguard the transcriptional dynamics of early embryos.     Analyses of transcriptional profiles and chromatin state in TRIM28 WT and KO cells
 E-MEXP-1714 - Chromatin immunoprecipitation of mouse hepatocytes with anti-Hnf1 antibody Chromatin from mouse hepatocytes was immunoprecipitated with anibodies anti-Hnf1 (SC, recognizes both Hnf1alpha and Hnf1beta). Amplified and labelled ChIP DNA and input DNA were hybridyzed to Mouse PromoterChip 5A.0 arrays.
 E-GEOD-20583 - Global Profiling of Activin Target Genes in Mouse Granulosa Cells In order to understand the mechanisms and pathways by which activin regulates follicle function, we performed a microarray study and identified activin regulated genes in mouse ovarian granulose cells.      Primary cultured ovarian granulosa cells collected from day 21-23 old immature mice were treated with Activin A (A), Activin A plus its antagonist follistatin (AplusF), and PBS (P, vehicle) for 24 h. RNA from each treatment group was isolated and the experiments were repeated four times.     Samples from experiment one were assigned as P1, A1 and A+F1, samples from experiment two as P2, A2 and A+F2, and so on.  About 100 ng of each RNA sample was amplified using a modified Eberwine T7-based amplification protocol and hybridized to the Illumina Sentrix Mouse-6 Expression BeadChip (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) that contains 48,000 sets of oligonucleotides.
 E-GEOD-42185 - LncRNAs expression profiles in the livers of 20-month-old male HBx transgenic mice and C57BL/6 wild-type mice The hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) has been implicated as an oncogene in both epigenetic modifications and genetic regulation during hepatocarcinogenesis, but the underlying mechanisms are not entirely clear.     Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which regulate gene expression with little or no protein-coding capacity, are involved in diverse biological processes and in carcinogenesis.     We asked whether HBx could promote hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by regulating the expression of lncRNAs.In this study, we investigated the alteration in expression of lncRNAs induced by HBx using microarrays, and our results indicate that HBx transgenic mice have a specific profile of liver lncRNAs compared with wild-type mice.     For these experiments, six each of 20-month-old male HBx-transgenic mice and wild-type C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed and the livers were removed.     Every three livers were pooled as one sample; therefore, each group was represented by two samples.     The total RNA was extracted from the four samples and used for microarray experiments.     Mouse LncRNA Array (4 x 44K, ArrayStar, Rockville, MD) were used to monitor the expression level of approximately 14000 lncRNAs identified from the NCBI RefSeq, UCSC, RNAdb2.0, NRED, Fantom3.0 and UCRs. LncRNAs differentially expressed were identified by comparing expression levels in HBx-transgenic mice and wild-type mice.
 E-GEOD-1863 - Dual Ligand Effects We identified differentially expressed genes in response to single and double ligand treatments (LPS, IFG, 2MA, LPS plus 2MA, and LPS plus IFG). The majority of the regulated transcripts responded additively to dual ligand treatment.     However, a significant fraction responded in a non-additive fashion.     Several cytokines showing non-additive transcriptional responses to dual ligand treatment also showed non-additive protein production/secretion responses in separate experiments.     Many of the genes with non-additive responses to LPS plus 2MA showed enhanced responses and encoded pro-inflammatory proteins.     On the other hand, LPS plus IFG appeared to induce both non-additive enhancement and non-additive attenuation of gene expression.     The affected genes were associated with a variety of biological functions.     These experiments reveal both dependent and independent regulatory pathways and further analyses may point out the specific nature of the regulatory interactions.

 E-GEOD-19157 - Microarray analysis of murine kidney treated with Amodiaquine and Sulfodoxine-Pyrimethamine Differential gene expression in mice kidney after Amodiaquine and Sulfodoxine-Pyrimethamine anti-malaria treatments were evaluated.     Dosages were decided based on standard malaria therapy in human.     Mice (Mus musculus) belonging to control and Amodiaquine and Sulfodoxine-Pyrimethamine administered groups (n=4) were sacrificed.     The kidneys were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and subsequently stored at -80ºC till further use.     Kidney samples were homogenized and total RNA was extracted with TRI reagent.     25 ug of total RNA was converted into labeled cDNA using CyScribe first strand cDNA labeling kit.     The Cy5 and Cy3 labeled cDNAs were resuspended in Cyscribe Hyb buffer containing 10ug/ml sheared Salmon sperm DNA and 10ug/ml Yeast tRNA. The labeled samples were hybridized to the arrays and incubated for 16-18hrs at 42ºC. Fluorescent array images were collected for both Cy3 and Cy5 with Molecular Dynamics III scanner supported with ImageQuant v5.0. Image intensity data were extracted and analyzed with ArrayVision v8.0 analysis software.     Background-corrected data was LOWESS normalized and log ratios were calculated using Avadis v4. Further, mean log ratios were calculated for duplicate spots.     Duplicate experiments were carried out for all the dosages.

 E-GEOD-57643 - LncRNAs expression profiling in adipose tissues and during brown adipocyte differentiation Brown and beige fats generate heat via uncoupled respiration to defend against cold, mechanistically, through the action of a network of transcription factors and cofactors.     Here we globally profiled long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) gene expression during thermogenic adipocyte formation and identified Brown fat lncRNA 1 (Blnc1) as a novel nuclear lncRNA that promotes brown and beige adipocyte differentiation and function by forming a feedforward regulatory loop with EBF2 to drive adipogenesis toward thermogenic phenotype.     LncRNAs expression were measured in BAT and WAT from mice injected saline/CL and during brown adipocyte differentiation with two replicates using Arraystar Mouse LncRNA microarray V2.0
 E-GEOD-11136 - Transcription profiling of mouse FVB/N wild type and transgenic Tg.AC mice to examine skin papilloma development This study analyzes gene expression associated with papilloma development in Tg.AC v-Ha-ras transgenic mice and identifies novel genes and biological processes that may be critical to skin carcinogenesis in these mice.      Epidermal abrasion was used to synchronously induce epidermal regeneration in FVB/N wild type and transgenic Tg.AC mice.      Skin papillomagenesis was uniquely induced in Tg.AC mice, and gene expression profiling was carried out using a 22,000 element mouse DNA microarray.      Histological analysis showed that papillomas developed at a high rate by day 30 after abrasion in transgenic animals, while no papilloma developed in wild type mice.      Transgene specific differentially expressed genes were identified at day 30 post-abrasion and these genes were annotated using EASE software and literature mining.      Annotated and non-annotated genes associated with papilloma development were identified and clustering analysis revealed groups of genes that are coordinately expressed.      A number of genes associated with differentiation and development were also physically clustered on mouse chromosome 16, including 16B3 that contains several Stefins and stefin-like genes, and 16A1 containing a number of keratin associated protein genes.      Additional analyses presented here yield novel insights into the genes and processes involved in papilloma development in Tg.AC mice.     Experiment Overall Design: Strains: Tg.AC vs FVB/N; Treatment: epidermal abrasion vs sham treatment, samples collected 3, 5, 9, 18, and 30 days post treatment; Microarray: 2-channel, pooled total RNA from 5 animals, 2 technical replicate arrays with dye-swaps.
 E-GEOD-4312 - Transcription profiling of mouse lung and skin from A/J, C57BL/6J and C3H/HeMs strains treated with gamma rays to identify radiation-induced gene expression. Gene expression profiling  was used to identify genes that display radiation-induced transcriptional change over mouse strain and tissue differences.     Experiment Overall Design: Inbred A/J, C57BL/6J and C3H/HeMs female mice were irradiated by gamma-rays as local irradiation in single doses to the thorax or hind leg.     The animals were sacrificed at 1, 12 and 72 hours after irradiation.     Non-irradiated mice served as the controls.     The lungs and skin were dissected and used for expression analysis.     Each sample including non-irradiated control was hybridized with global control that derived from mixture of commercially available total RNA from ten organs.

 E-GEOD-8566 - Transcription profiling of mouse C57BL/6 animals exposed daily to LPS by inhalation for up to two months followed by one month of recovery Chronic LPS inhalation causes submucosal thickening and airway narrowing.     To address the hypothesis that environmental airway disease is, in part, a fibroproliferative lung disease, we exposed C57BL/6 mice daily to LPS by inhalation for up to two months followed by one month of recovery.     C57BL/6 mice exposed to daily inhaled LPS had significantly enhanced mRNA expression of TGF-1, TIMP-1, fibronectin-1, and pro-collagen types I, III, and IV and show prominent submucosal expression of the myofibroblast markers desmin and -smooth muscle actin.     To identify novel candidate genes that contribute to airway fibroproliferation, we performed microarray analysis on total lung RNA from mice exposed to LPS for one week.     This analysis revealed a distinct subset of genes known to regulate ECM homeostasis.     To further identify candidate genes specifically involved in generic fibroproliferation we interrogated this analysis with genes induced in C57BL/6 mouse lung by bleomycin.     This analysis yielded a list of 212 genes in common.     Prominent among which are genes know to be important in maintenance of bone homeostasis and which may play a central role in ECM homeostasis in the lung.     These results suggest that there is a common subset of genes that regulate fibroproliferation in the lung independent of etiologic agent and site of injury.     Experiment Overall Design: 4 RNA pools of 3 animals each exposed to aerosolized LPS and 4 RNA pools of 3 animals each exposed to air only were co-hybridized with the Stratagene Universal Mouse Reference RNA. Each sample was assayed in duplicate with Cy3 and Cy5 dyes swapped.     Experiment Overall Design:
 E-MEXP-355 - Transcription profiling of mouse activin treated MEKK1 wild type and KO keratinocytes MEKK1 wildtype and knockout keratinocytes were compared both with and without activin (10 ng/ml) treatment for 12 hours, and control vs activin treated cells were compared both for wildtype and knockout.     This was performed in a square design.
 E-GEOD-45248 - Defining a molecular roadmap of cellular reprogramming into iPS Cells [DNA methylation] Factor-induced reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is inefficient, complicating mechanistic studies.     Here, we examined defined intermediate cell populations poised to becoming iPSCs by genome-wide analyses.     We show that induced pluripotency elicits two transcriptional waves, which are driven by c-Myc/Klf4 (first wave) and Oct4/Sox2/Klf4 (second wave). Cells that become refractory to reprogramming activate the first but fail to initiate the second transcriptional wave and can be rescued by elevated expression of all four factors.     The establishment of bivalent domains occurs gradually after the first wave, whereas changes in DNA methylation take place after the second wave when cells acquire stable pluripotency.     This integrative analysis allowed us to identify genes that act as roadblocks during reprogramming and surface markers that further enrich for cells prone to forming iPSCs. Collectively, our data offer new mechanistic insights into the nature and sequence of molecular events inherent to cellular reprogramming.     DNA methylation profiles obtained at different timepoints during reprogramming of somatic cells: Day 0, +3, +6, +9 and iPSC
 E-GEOD-21548 - Gene Expression Profiles of RAW264.7 Macrophages Stimulated with Two Commonly Used Preparations of LPS Background:  Toll-like family of receptors recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from different organisms.      TLR4 is the receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), dsRNA viral mimic poly(I:C) binds to TLR3, and bacterial CpG DNA signals through TLR9.  TLR4 signaling is mediated by adaptor molecules Myd88 and TRIF while TLR3 pathway involves only the TRIF adaptor and TLR9 signals solely through Myd88.      Methods:  To identify genes other than those in TLR pathways that mediate macrophage response to different PAMPs, RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with LPS, poly(I:C), or CpG DNA, and RNA was profiled on microarrays 6 hrs and 24 hrs post-treatment.      Gene expression data were analyzed to determine genes, pathways and transcriptional networks that are in common and unique to each of the three TLR stimuli.      Potentially novel candidates revealed by this analysis were tested for their role in innate immunity using RNA interference.        Results:  Many genes are differentially regulated by LPS and poly(I:C) at both 6 hrs and 24 hrs following treatment, while CpG DNA elicits a much less pronounced transcriptional response.      By analyzing gene expression data for networks and pathways, we prioritized differentially expressed genes that are in common to all three PAMPs as well as those shared by LPS and poly(I:C).  Knockdown by RNA interference of two genes, Plec1 and TPST1, inhibited production of IL-6 in response to LPS in cultured macrophages.          Conclusions:  We have identified novel innate immunity genes that may be important in macrophage response to LPS, poly(I:C), and CpG DNA stimuli.      Our results provide potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets that should be further investigated in mice and human populations.      Keywords: time course For each treatment (Sigma LPS, LIST LPS, and media only), three biological replicates (separate macrophage cultures and RNA isolations) were profiled.      Each sample was labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 and co-hybridized with Stratagene Universal Mouse Reference (dye flip techical replicates).  Expression at 2 timepoints (6 and 24 hours post-treatment) was assessed.
 E-GEOD-46683 - A novel methyl-binding domain protein enrichment method for identifying genome-wide tissue-specific DNA methylation from nanogram DNA samples Growing evidence suggests that DNA methylation plays a role in tissue-specific differentiation.     Current approaches to methylome analysis using MBD-enrichment are restricted to large (≥1 µg) DNA samples, limiting the analysis of small tissue samples.     Here we present a technique which enables characterization of genome wide tissue-specific methylation patterns from nanogram quantities of DNA. We have developed a methodology utilizing MBD2b/MBD3L1-enrichment for methylated DNA, kinase pre-treated ligation-mediated PCR amplification (MeKL) and hybridization to the comprehensive high-throughput array for relative methylation (CHARM) customized NimbleGen 2.1M mouse tiling arrays (Feinberg MM8 Me HX1), which we termed MeKL-chip.     The kinase-modification in combination with the addition of PEG have increased the ligation-mediated PCR amplification over 20-fold, enabling  400-fold amplification of starting DNA.  We have shown that MeKL-chip can be applied to as little as 20 ng DNA, enabling comprehensive analysis of small DNA samples.     Applying MeKL-chip to the mouse retina (a limited tissue source) and brain, 2498 tissue-specific differentially methylated regions (T-DMRs) were characterized.      The top five T-DMRs (Rgs20, Hes2, Nfic, Cckbr and Six3os1) were validated by pyrosequencing.       MeKL-chip enables genome-wide methylation analysis of nanogram quantities of DNA with a wide range of observed-to-expected CpG ratios due to the binding properties of the MBD2b/MBD3L1 protein complex.     This methodology enabled the first analysis of genome-wide methylation in the mouse retina, characterizing novel T-DMRs. MBD-enrichment was performed on 3 x retina  and 3 x brain DNA samples from adult C57BL/6J mice on varied DNA quantities (250, 50, 25 and 10 ng). Samples were amplified using a modified ligation-mediated PCR and hybridized to custom NimbleGen 2.1M mouse arrays (Feinberg MM8 Me HX1)
 E-GEOD-42503 - Timecourse of mCMV Infection of Bone Marrow-Derived Macrophages (BMDMs) The systematic temporal gene expression analysis of primary macrophages activated under immune (interferon-gamma) and productive viral infection with murine cytomegalovirus (mCMV). The primary objective of the study is to define, in an unbiased manner, cause-and-effect relationships in the program of gene activation in this cellular system.     The even spacing and time intervals (every 30 minutes) makes this study amenable to modelling of gene networks in the system.     A kinetic analysis of mCMV infection on the gene expression of murine (BALB/c) bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) over the first 12 hours, sampling every 30 minutes.     Agilent mouse genome arrays were used to determine the differences in gene expression between mock and mCMV infected.     The 25 samples collected for the mock infected were pooled and treated as a pooled control.     Pooled control was labelled with Cy3 dye and hybridised with every other sample (labelled with Cy5 dye) = 25 dual-dye array hybridisations.     The reference channel of the dual-channel hybridisations was only used to normalise the expression of the test channel, rather than used to calculate ratio data.     Thus, the normalised data represent log2 single-channel data.

 E-GEOD-73126 - Mapping of nascent RNA in MLL2 F/F and FC/FC MEF cells Global Run-On has been performed in MLL2 F/F and FC/FC MEF cells.     The aim of the experiment is to test how the lack of MLL2 affects nascent RNA transcription.     Four samples were analyzed - 2 independent replicates.     The experiments were performed using immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) in which both MLL2 alleles were targeted by the loxp system (F/F cells). Tamoxifen treatment of the F/F cells for 24 hours results in the excision of both MLL2 alleles (FC/FC cells).
 E-GEOD-25265 - Genome-wide analysis of the binding pattern of the transcriptional co-activator Cbp. The transcriptional coactivator Cbp is critical for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) development.     However, its role in adult HSC and the mechanistic detail of Cbp control of HSC function remain unknown.     Using conditional deletion of Cbp in the adult HSC compartment, we demonstrate an altered balance between differentiation and self-renewal with gradual loss of phenotypic HSC, differentiation defects in lower compartments and the development of myeloid malignancies.     In addition, we demonstrate that Cbp -/- HSCs reconstitute hematopoiesis with lower efficiency than their wild type counterparts and readily exhaust over time when placed under the replicative stress of serial transplantation.     Furthermore, we demonstrate abnormal cell cycle (re)entry and apoptosis in HSC which, with preferential differentiation, also contribute to stem cell exhaustion.     Finally we demonstrate global transcriptional abnormalities predicted to alter cell cycle control, balanced differentiation and HSC function upon Cbp deletion and link Cbp to a critical HSC transcriptional regulatory network through genome-wide analysis of Cbp binding.     1 sample (Cbp) and 1 control, all prepared from a hematopoietic progenitor/stem cell line (BM-HPC)

 E-GEOD-14675 - Identification of Hedgehog Signaling and Novel Transcription Factors Involved in Regulation of Systemic Response to LPS Background: Our understanding of the role host genetic factors play in the initiation and severity of infections caused by Gram negative bacteria is incomplete.     Methods: To identify novel regulators of the host response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 11 inbred murine strains were challenged with LPS systemically.      RNA from lung, liver, and spleen tissue was profiled on oligonucleotide microarrays to determine if unique transcripts differentiate susceptible and resistant strains of mice.      Gene expression data were analyzed to identify over-represented pathways and transcription factors (TFs).  The role of several TFs in innate immune response to LPS was examined by RNA interference in a mouse macrophage cell line.      Mouse lines with targeted mutations were utilized to further confirm involvement of two novel genes in innate immunity.     Results: In addition to two strains lacking functional TLR4 (C3H/HeJ and C57BL/6JTLR4-/-), three murine strains with functional TLR4 (C57BL/6, 129/SvlmJ, and NZW/LacJ) were found to be resistant to systemic LPS challenge; the other six strains were classified as sensitive.      Gene expression analysis supports the involvement of a number of previously identified genes, molecular pathways, and TFs in the host response to LPS but also identifies Hedgehog signaling as a novel pathway activated by LPS.  B6;129Ptch1+/+ wild-type mice were shown to be more sensitive to systemic LPS than B6;129Ptch1+/- heterozygote littermates further supporting the role of Hedgehog signaling in systemic LPS response.      RNA interference-mediated inhibition of 6 TFs (C/EBP, Cdx-2, E2F1, Hoxa4, Nhlh1, and Tead2), out of 15 tested, was found to diminish production of IL-6 and TNF protein in murine macrophages.      The role of E2F1 was confirmed by showing that B6;129E2F1-/- knockout mice are more sensitive to systemic LPS than wild-type controls.     Conclusions: Our analysis of gene expression data identified novel pathways and transcription factors that regulate the host response to systemic LPS.  Our results provide potential sepsis biomarkers and therapeutic targets that should be further investigated in human populations.      Keywords: disease state analysis For each strain of mice, 6 mice were treated with LPS and 6 with saline.      RNA of 3 animals was pooled to make two pools per condition (two biological replicates).  Each pool was labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 and co-hybridized with Stratagene Univeral Mouse Reference (dye flip techical replicates). RNA from lung, liver, and spleen tissue was profiled on oligonucleotide microarrays
 E-GEOD-15066 - Macrophage Response to LPS, poly(I:C) and CpG DNA Stimulation Molecular Pathways and Transcriptional Networks Involved in the Macrophage Response to LPS, poly(I:C) and CpG DNA Stimulation  Background:  Toll-like family of receptors recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from different organisms.      TLR4 is the receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), dsRNA viral mimic poly(I:C) binds to TLR3, and bacterial CpG DNA signals through TLR9.  TLR4 signaling is mediated by adaptor molecules Myd88 and TRIF while TLR3 pathway involves only the TRIF adaptor and TLR9 signals solely through Myd88.

Conclusions:  We have identified novel innate immunity genes that may be important in macrophage response to LPS, poly(I:C), and CpG DNA stimuli.      Our results provide potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets that should be further investigated in mice and human populations.     For each treatment (LPS, polyIC, CpG DNA, media only), three biological replicates (separate macrophage cultures and RNA isolations) were profiled.      Each sample was labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 and co-hybridized with Stratagene Universal Mouse Reference (dye flip techical replicates).  Expression at 2 timepoints (6 and 24 hours post-treatment) was assessed.
 E-GEOD-15360 - Gene expression analysis of dendritic cells treated with small chemical compounds Identification of newer compounds to modulate dendritic cell functions.     Total RNA obtained from bone marrow-derived dendritic cells treated for 6 hours with small chemical compounds or vehicle alone in the presence or absence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
 E-GEOD-11244 - Calorie Restriction Feminizes Liver Gene Expression and Alters Key Regulators of Conserved Aging Regulatory Pathways Background: Calorie restriction (CR) is the only intervention known to extend lifespan in a wide range of organisms, including mammals.     However, the mechanisms by which it regulates mammalian aging remain largely unknown and the involvement of the TOR and Sirtuin pathways (which regulate aging in lower organisms) remain controversial.     Femaleness is a second phenotype generally associated with longevity but the relationship between sex-biased and CR-induced gene expression remains undetermined.        Methodology/Principal Findings: We generated microarray gene expression data from livers of male mice fed high calorie or CR diets, and we find that CR significantly changes the expression of over 3,000 genes, many between 10- and 50-fold.     We compare our data to the GenAge database of known aging-related genes and to prior microarray expression data of genes expressed differently between male and female mice.     CR generally feminizes gene expression and many of the most significantly changed individual genes are involved in aging, hormone signaling, and p53-associated regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis.     Among the genes showing the largest and most statistically significant CR-induced expression differences are Ddit4, a key regulator of the TOR pathway, and Nnmt, a regulator of lifespan linked to the Sirtuin pathway.     Using Western analyses, we confirmed post-translational inhibition of the TOR pathway.        Conclusions: Our data show that CR induces widespread gene expression changes and acts through highly evolutionarily conserved pathways, from microorganisms to mammals, and that its life-extension effects might arise partly from a shift toward a gene expression profile more typical of the longer-lived female sex.     Keywords: Two-class gene expression comparison.     Calorie restriction (CR) versus HIGH CALORIE feeding.     Design of the experiment is a two-class paired design in which the two classes are HIGH CALORIE and CALORIE RESTRICTION (CR) dietary regimens fed to mice, resulting in 15 HIGH CALORIE microarrays and 8 CR microarrays; 23 total microarrays.     Four HIGH CALORIE and 2 CR microarrays were produced using pools of 3 RNA samples for each microarray (6 pools of 3, plus 17 individual samples = 35 individual mouse liver samples, 23 microarrays).

 E-GEOD-70501 - Expansion of hepatic tumor progenito cell population in PTEN deficient mice requires liver injury and is reversed by deletion of Akt2 We found that hepatic injury induced by PTEN loss establishes a selection pressure for tumorinitiating cells (TICs) to proliferate and form mixed lineage tumors.     The Pten null mice demonstrate escalating levels of hepatic injury prior to proliferation of hepatic progenitors.     Attenuation of hepatic injury by deleting Akt2 reduces progenitor cell proliferation and delays tumor development.     Treatment of double mutant mice with 3,5-dietoxycarbonyl-1,4  dihydrocollidine (DDC) shows that the primary effect of AKT2 loss is attenuation of hepatic injury and not inhibition of progenitor cell proliferation in response to injury.     Pten/Akt2 double mutant (PtenloxP/loxP; Akt2-/-; Alb-Cre+) (Dm) were generated by crossing the PtenloxP/loxP; Alb-Cre+ (Pm)  with the Akt2-/- mice [19]. Control animals are PtenloxP/loxP; Albumin (Alb)-Cre-.
 E-GEOD-45281 - Integration of genome-wide approaches identifies lncRNAs of adult neural stem cells and their progeny in vivo [lncRNA Array] Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been described in cell lines and various whole tissues, but lncRNA analysis of development in vivo is limited.     Here, we comprehensively analyze lncRNA expression for the adult mouse subventricular zone neural stem cell lineage.     We utilize complementary genome-wide techniques including RNA-seq, RNA CaptureSeq, and ChIP-seq to associate specific lncRNAs with neural cell types, developmental processes, and human disease states.     By integrating data from chromatin state maps, custom microarrays, and FACS purification of the subventricular zone lineage, we stringently identify lncRNAs with potential roles in adult neurogenesis.     shRNA-mediated knockdown of two such lncRNAs, Six3os and Dlx1as, indicate roles for lncRNAs in the glial-neuronal lineage specification of multipotent adult stem cells.     Our data and workflow thus provide a uniquely coherent in vivo lncRNA analysis and form the foundation of a user-friendly online resource for the study of lncRNAs in development and disease.     SVZ monolayer cultures were differentiated in vitro for 1,2,4 days, and gene expression changes were measured.     SVZ lineage was isolated by FACS using established protocols to separate transit amplifying (TA), neuroblast (NB), activated stem cells (NSCs), and niche astrocytes (astros), and gene expression of each cell type was measured.     All arrays are custom lncRNA arrays.

 E-GEOD-36046 - microRNA signatures of iPSCs and endoderm-derived tissues MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs that fine-tune gene expression, play multiple roles in the cell, including cell fate specification.     We have analyzed the differential expression of miRNAs during fibroblast reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and endoderm induction in iPSCs upon treatment with high concentrations of Activin-A in reduced serum.     During reprogramming, adult mouse fibroblasts are converted into cells that resemble embryonic stem cells (ESCs) according to standard molecular and functional assays for pluripotency.     The reprogrammed iPSCs assume an ESC-like miRNA signature, marked by the strong induction of pluripotency clusters miR-290-295 and miR-302/367 and conversely the downregulation of the let-7 family.     On the other hand, endoderm induction in iPSCs results in the upregulation of 13 miRNAs. Given that the liver and the pancreas are common derivatives of the endoderm, the comparison of the expression levels of these 13 upregulated miRNAs with those in hepatocytes and pancreatic islets suggests a trend of miRNA upregulation in the endoderm tending towards an islet phenotype rather than that of a hepatocyte.     These observations provide insights into how differentiation may be guided more efficiently towards the endoderm and further into the liver or pancreas.     Moreover, we also report novel miRNAs enriched for each of the cell types analyzed.     Stemloop RT-qPCR gene expression profiling.     REPROGRAMMING: Differentially expressed miRNAs were determined between iPSCs (n=5 clones) and parent tail-tip fibroblasts (n=5) using mESCs R1 (n=3) and D3 (n=3). DIFFERENTIATION: Differentially expressed miRNAs were also analyzed in two iPSC clones upon treatment with Activin-A (n=2 each), and between primary mouse hepatocytes (n=3) and pancreatic islets (n=3).
 E-GEOD-53547 - Multiple mechanisms mediate the taurine-induced proliferation of neural stem/progenitor cells from the subventricular zone of the adult mouse Taurine was previously reported to increase the proliferation of neural precursor cells (NPCs) from subventricular zone of the mouse brain.     The results of a study that aimed to understand the mechanisms of this effect are presented here.     A gene expression profile analysis indicated that genes regulated by taurine have roles in proliferation, cellular adhesion, cell survival, and mitochondrial functioning.     Together with additional functional analyses, the results suggest that taurine provides more favorable conditions for cell proliferation by improving mitochondrial functioning.     The total RNA from the control and taurine NPC cultures was used to produce tagged complementary DNA (cDNA) probes.     Hybridation analysis used the mouse 65-mer oligo library from Sigma-Genosys to compare the expression of 23,232 gene-specific oligonucleotide probes for mouse.
 E-GEOD-46896 - Developmentally regulated lncRNAs expression in male germline To decipher the roles of non-coding RNAs during male germline development, we use the lncRNAs microarray to profile the genome-wide lncRNAs expression pattern in the male germline Testes samples from 6 time points were collected for lncRNAs and mRNAs microarray profiling
 E-GEOD-18221 - Expression profiling of murine hemopoietic cell survival on cDNA arrays. Deregulated cell survival programs are a classical hallmark of cancer.     We have previously identified a serine residue (Ser585) in the beta-c subunit of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor that selectively and independently promotes cell survival.     We now show that Ser585 phosphorylation is constitutive in 20/23 (87%) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient samples indicating that this survival-only pathway is frequently deregulated in leukemia.     We performed a global expression screen to identify gene targets of this survival pathway and report a 138-gene beta-c Ser585-regulated transcriptome.     Pathway analysis defines a gene network enriched for PI 3-kinase target genes as well as a cluster of genes involved in cancer and cell survival.     factorial design; factors: time x 2 & mutation, same RNA was used in both GSE18220 & GSE18221
 E-GEOD-6317 - Transcription profiling of mouse liver exposed to 24h cytokine starvation vs. treatment with TNF alpha Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis results from the interactions between disrupted lipid homeostasis and immune response but the molecular bridges between the major players are still a matter of controversy.     We investigated the systemic effect of inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), a well established anorexia agent, in livers; of mice exposed to 24h-cytokine/starvation.     10% of genes of the Agilent 10kb cDNA array is detected above level of detection in the mouse liver.     12% of these is modulated upon starvation while 22% is altered by TNF-α. Experiment Overall Design: Twelve mice (C57BL/6, Harlan) were randomly assigned into three groups.     Three animals were i.v. injected by human recombinant TNF-α (30 µg/animal), a dose that is known to have a significant effect in Experiment Overall Design: mice without leading to mortality.     Food was withdrawn after application of TNF-alpha (TNF/starvation group). Further, for three animals which were treated with corresponding volume (200µl) of saline a food was withdrawn (starvation group). Three animals from control group had free access to food throughout the study.     Mice were sacrificed 20 hours later.     Livers for RNA analysis were stored in RNAlater (Quiagen) according to manufacture's instruction.     RNA of individual treated mouse was hybridized versus control sample which is obtained by pooling of control RNAs.
 E-GEOD-2597 - Contrasting patterns of expression divergence in early and late stages of population divergence in mice We compared gene expression differences in the polytypic species complex Mus musculus (Mus musculus musculus, Mus musculus domesticus, Mus musculus castaneus and Mus musculus ssp) with that of Mus spretus via oligonucleotide microarrays representing more than 20,000 genes.     Analysis of the results by two way ANOVA statistics suggests that the most genes with significant differences in expression levels among the subspecies are found in liver and kidney and the least in testis.     This picture is different when one compares with Mus spretus, where the largest number of differences is found in testis.     The design we employed is a reference design.     All tissues were hybridized against a pool of that same tissue from 9 C57BL6 mice.     All mice were roughly 12 weeks of age.     To control for biological variation, we have used several individual males from each sub-species.     RNA was isolated from three different organs, namely brain, liver/kidney and testis.
 E-GEOD-4647 - Transcription profiling of mouse mammary gland development identifies estrogen-responsive genes in an estrogen-specific mammary gland outgrowth model Both ovarian and pituitary hormones are required for the pubertal development of the mouse mammary gland.     Estradiol directs ductal elongation and branching within the adipose stroma of the adolescent mouse mammary gland, while progesterone leads to tertiary branching and alveolar development.     The purpose of this investigation was to identify the estrogen-responsive genes that are associated with estrogen-stimulated ductal elongation and branching in the mouse mammary gland in the absence of other ovarian hormones.     We also wanted to determine if estrogen-responsive gene regulation at early stages of ductal elongation (ie. when ductal growth was minimal) was similar to those regulated after significant ductal elongation had occurred.     To identify estrogen-regulated genes, ovariectomized prepubertal mice were exposed to 17beta-estradiol for four weeks, and mammary gland global gene expression analyzed by microarray analysis at various points during this time course.     We determined that while many genes are regulated in all weeks of treatment, there remained a subset of genes that was uniquely regulated at each time-point.     This observation was reflected in the biological functions of these genes; some categories were represented in all weeks of treatment while others were specific to only certain time-points.     We have also identified estradiol-responsive genes in the mouse mammary gland that co-express with Estrogen Receptor alpha in human breast cancer, which may represent novel effectors of estrogen action and/or biomarkers for the progression of estrogen-dependent cancers and other estrogen-driven diseases.     Experiment Overall Design: For each time-course experiment, one frozen #4 mammary gland was individually pulverized from four to five animals per treatment group, then homogenized in 3mL Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and RNA was prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol.     The RNA from individual animals was then pooled for each treatment group (four to five animals per group) and further purified using the QIAGEN (Valencia, CA) RNeasy Mini kit (Cat. No. 74104) clean-up protocol.      Experiment Overall Design: Gene expression analysis was conducted using Agilent Mouse Oligo arrays (pattern number 011978) (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Total RNA was amplified using the Agilent Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit protocol.     Starting with 500ng of total RNA, Cy3 or Cy5 labeled cRNA was produced according to manufacturer’s protocol.     For each two color comparison, 750ng of each Cy3 and Cy5 labeled cRNAs were mixed and fragmented using the Agilent In Situ Hybridization Kit protocol.     In each case, samples from estradiol-treated animals were co-hybridized with the day 7 placebo sample.     Due to the rapid increase in adiposity in the mammary fat pad in the ovariectomized placebo-treated mice in days 14 and 28, the day 7 placebo sample was used as a control for all estradiol treated samples to avoid any variation due to this biological difference.     Hybridizations were performed for 17 hours in a rotating hybridization oven using the Agilent 60-mer oligo microarray processing protocol.     Slides were washed as indicated in this protocol and then scanned with an Agilent Scanner.     Data was obtained using the Agilent Feature Extraction software (v7.5), using defaults for all parameters.     Experiment Overall Design: The Agilent Feature Extraction Software performed error modeling, adjusting for additive and multiplicative noise.     The resulting data were processed using the Rosetta Resolver® system (version 7.1) (Rosetta Biosoftware, Kirkland, WA).
 E-GEOD-71736 - The requirement of leukemia inhibitory factor or epidermal growth factor for pre-implantation embryogenesis In this study, we further verified the role of LIF by looking at gene expressions in morula stage embryos through DNA microarray.     Our results showed that LIF knockdown affected 373 gene expressions, and after LIF supplementation we found that the epidermal growth factor (EGF) is most affected by LIF expression.     In order to observe the correlation between LIF and EGF, the LIF knockdown embryos were supplemented with various growth factors including LIF, EGF, GM-CSF, TGF, and IGF II. Only LIF and EGF caused the rate of blastocyst development to recover from 52% of control significantly to 83% and 93%, respectively, and all of the parameters, such as the diameter of blastocysts, the numbers of blastomeres, and cells in ICM and TE, to mostly be restored.     Moreover, EGF knockdown also impaired blastocyst development which was reversed by LIF or EGF supplementation.     These data suggest that the two growth factors EGF and LIF can be compensatory to each other during early embryonic development, and one of them is necessary for sustaining the normal development of preimplantation embryos.     Two-condition experiment, mouse embryos vs. LIF-deficiency mouse embryos at morula stage
 E-GEOD-21273 - DNMT3B7 disrupts embryonic development and accelerates lymphomagenesis Cancer cells have an altered distribution of DNA methylation and express aberrant DNA methyltransferase 3B transcripts, which encode truncated proteins.     To test if a truncated DNMT3B isoform disrupts DNA methylation in vivo, we constructed transgenic mice expressing DNMT3B7, a common truncated DNMT3B isoform in cancer cells.     DNMT3B7 transgenic mice exhibit altered embryonic development, including lymphopenia, craniofacial abnormalities, and cardiac defects, similar to Dnmt3b-deficient animals, but rarely develop cancer.      However, DNMT3B7 expression increases the frequency of mediastinal lymphomas in Eμ−myc animals.     Eμ-myc/DNMT3B7 lymphomas have more chromosomal rearrangements, increased global methylation levels, and more locus-specific perturbations in DNA methylation patterns compared to Eμ-myc lymphomas.     Our results demonstrate that a truncated DNMT3B protein can alter tumorigenesis, suggesting a similar role in human tumors.     Direct comparison of DNA methylation in lymphoma samples from Eu-Myc vs Eu-Myc/Dnmt3b7 mice.
 E-GEOD-5980 - Differential gene expression in mice liver following bulaquine administration Global gene expression in livers of bulaquine treated mice was compared with control mice at different time points.     Keywords: Time course Mice (Mus musculus) belonging to control and bulaquine-administered groups (n=4) were sacrificed.     The livers were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and subsequently stored at -80ºC till further use.     Liver samples were homogenized and total RNA was extracted with TRI reagent.     25 ug of total RNA was converted into labeled cDNA using CyScribe first strand cDNA labeling kit.     The Cy5 and Cy3 labeled cDNAs were resuspended in Cyscribe Hyb buffer containing 10ug/ml sheared Salmon sperm DNA and 10ug/ml Yeast tRNA. The labeled samples were hybridized to the arrays and incubated for 16-18hrs at 42ºC. Fluorescent array images were collected for both Cy3 and Cy5 with molecular dynamics III scanner supported with ImageQuant v5.0. Image intensity data were extracted and analyzed with ArrayVision v8.0 analysis software.     Background corrected data was LOWESS normalized and log ratios were calculated using Avadis v4. Replicate experiments were carried out in dye swap manner for each time point.

Livers from control mice were compared with drug treated mice livers at different time points.     Keywords: Time-course Mice (Mus musculus) belonging to control and carbon tetrachloride and acetaminophen-administered groups (n=4) were sacrificed.     The livers were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and subsequently stored at -80ºC till further use.

 E-GEOD-8553 - Transcription profiling of mouse with bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis for comparison with chronic LPS exposure Chronic LPS inhalation causes submucosal thickening and airway narrowing.      To address the hypothesis that environmental airway disease is, in part, a fibroproliferative lung disease, we exposed C57BL/6 mice daily to LPS by inhalation for up to two months followed by one month of recovery.      C57BL/6 mice exposed to daily inhaled LPS had significantly enhanced mRNA expression of TGF-1, TIMP-1, fibronectin-1, and pro-collagen types I, III, and IV and show prominent submucosal expression of the myofibroblast markers desmin and -smooth muscle actin.      To identify novel candidate genes that contribute to airway fibroproliferation, we performed microarray analysis on total lung RNA from mice exposed to LPS for one week.      This analysis revealed a distinct subset of genes known to regulate ECM homeostasis.      To further identify candidate genes specifically involved in generic fibroproliferation we interrogated this analysis with genes induced in C57BL/6 mouse lung by bleomycin.      This analysis yielded a list of 212 genes in common.      Prominent among which are genes know to be important in maintenance of bone homeostasis and which may play a central role in ECM homeostasis in the lung.      These results suggest that there is a common subset of genes that regulate fibroproliferation in the lung independent of etiologic agent and site of injury.       Experiment Overall Design: For each timepoint (1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks), 2 RNA pools of 3 animals each treated intratracheally with bleomycin and 1 RNA pool of 3 animals each treated with saline control were co-hybridized with the Stratagene Universal Mouse Reference RNA.  Each sample was assayed in duplicate with Cy3 and Cy5 dyes swapped.
 E-MTAB-873 - MicroRNA expression profiling of Igf2-p and H19-m mutant mouse embryos Changes in microRNA expression in Igf2-p and H19-m mouse embryos (E9.5) were determined in order to assess whether perturbation of miR-483  and miR-675 in Igf2-p and H19-m mutants was likely to have contributed to a modification of tumour phenotype.     The Igf2 gene contains miR-483  but the targeted deletion of Igf2-p in these mice spares the region encoding this microRNA. The H19 gene contains miR-675 and its expression was mono-allelelic in heterozygous H19-m mice as evidenced by a significant reduction in miR-675 in these mice relative to WT.
 E-GEOD-41444 - Airn transcriptional overlap but not its lncRNA products induce imprinted Igf2r silencing. To test if the imprinted long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Airn transcription or its product silences the protein-coding Igf2r gene, we shortened the endogenous lncRNA to four different lengths by inserting polyadenylation (polyA) cassettes on the paternal chromosome via homologous recombination in ES cells.     ES cell differentiation was used to recapitulate the developmental onset of Airn and Igf2r imprinted expression and polyA cassettes inserted before (T3, T16, T27) or after (T31, T51) the Igf2r promoter successfully truncated Airn, with the exception of T27. RNA hybridization to a tiling array (MIRTA) demonstrated loss of Airn upstream of the Igf2r promoter (except T27) and absence of novel spliced variants in all truncation alleles.      To further test the transcriptional overlap model we moved the Airn promoter ~700bp before the Igf2r TSS in ES cells that lack an endogenous paternal Airn promoter and called this cell line FAP (Forward-Airn-Promoter). RNA hybridization to a tiling array (MIRTA) demonstrated that the moved Airn promoter expresses Airn in wildtype orientation and terminates at the wildtype 3' end.     ES cell lines expressing different Airn variants were differentiated on gelatinized dishes after feeder cell depletion and LIF withdrawal by 0.27µM retinoic acid for 5 days and Airn length was assayed.
 E-GEOD-6628 - Transcription profiling of mouse brain from animals treated with cocaine vs controls Several recent reports show that the cerebral cortex in humans and animals with altered expressions of Wnt/cadherin network-associate molecules display cytoarchitectural abnormalities reminiscent of cortical dysplasias seen in some (mouse-, rat-, and monkey-based) animal models of prenatal cocaine exposure.     Therefore, we employed oligo microarrays followed by real-time RT-PCR to compare expressions of genes involved in Wnt and cadherin systems in the cerebral wall of 18-day-old (E18) fetuses from cocaine-treated (20 mg/kg cocaine, s.c., b.i.d., E8-18) and drug-naive (saline, s.c.) mice.     The pregnant mice chronically treated with cocaine in the above-described manner represent one of the animal models producing offspring with widespread cortical dysplasias.     Out of more than 150 relevant genes in the arrays, 32 were upregulated and 9 were downregulated in cocaine-exposed fetuses.     The majority of these genes (30 out of 41) were similarly affected in the frontal and occipital regions of the cerebral wall.     We also used Western immunoblotting to examine the ability of cocaine to regulate the protein levels of beta-catenin, the key functional component of both Wnt and cadherin systems.     While the total cell levels of beta-catenin were increased throughout the cerebral wall of cocaine-exposed fetuses, its nuclear (gene-transcription driving) levels remained unaltered.     This suggests a transcription-unrelated role for cocaine-induced upregulation of this protein.     Overall, our findings point to an intriguing possibility that that cerebral cortical dysplasias observed in several animal models of prenatal cocaine exposure may be at least in part related to alterations in the Wnt/cadherin molecular network.      It has been demonstrated that exposure to cocaine increases cell death in the fetal CNS. To examine the molecular mechanisms of this effect, we employed mouse oligo microarrays followed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) to compare expressions of apoptosis-related genes in the cerebral wall of 18-day-old (E18) fetuses from cocaine-treated (20 mg/kg cocaine, s.c., b.i.d., E8th-E18th) and drug-naive (saline, s.c.) mice.     Out of approximately 400 relevant genes in the arrays, 53 showed alterations in expression in cocaine-exposed fetuses.     Upregulation was observed in 35 proapoptotic and 8 antiapoptotic genes; 4 proapoptotic and 6 antiapoptotic genes were down-regulated.     The affected genes encode a wide range of apoptosis-related proteins, including death receptors (NTF-R1, NTF-R2, DR3, DR5, LTbeta-R, GITR, P57 TR-1) and their adaptor and regulatory proteins (MASGE-D1, TRAF-2, SIVA, MET, FLIP, FAIM, IAP1, ATFA), members of transcription regulatory pathways (JNK, NF-kappaB, P53), members of BCL-2 family of proteins (BID, BAD, BAX, BIK, NIP21, NIP3, NIX, BCL-2), DNA damage sensor (PARP-1), caspases and their substrates and regulatory proteins (caspases 8, 4, 9, and 3, ACINUS, CIDE-A, CIDE-B, GAS2), mitochondrially released factors (cytochrome c, AIF, PRG3), specific endoplasmic reticulum- and oxidative stress-associated factors (BACH2, ABL1, ALG2, CHOP), members of cell survival AKT and HSP70 pathways (PIK3GA, PTEN, HSP70, BAG1, BAG2), and others.     This suggests that cocaine affects survival of developing cerebral cells via multiple apoptosis-regulating mechanisms.     Experiment Overall Design: Animals Experiment Overall Design: Timed pregnant Swiss Webster (CFW; Charles River Experiment Overall Design: Lab. Wilmington, MA) dams were maintained in individual Experiment Overall Design: cages in a climate-controlled room on a 12/12-h light/ Experiment Overall Design: dark cycle.

 E-GEOD-26838 - Liver effects of Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in wild type (C57BL/6J) and hepatitis C virus-transgenic (HCV-Tg) mice Viral hepatitis and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) exposure are common risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The incidence of HCC in individuals co-exposed to hepatitis C (HCV) or B virus and AFB1 is greater than could be explained by the additive effect, yet the mechanisms are poorly understood due to lack of an animal model.     This study investigated the outcomes and mechanisms of combined exposure to HCV and AFB1. We hypothesized that HCV transgenic (HCV-Tg; expressing core, E1, E2, and p7, nucleotides 342-2771) mice will be prone to hepatocarcinogenesis when exposed to AFB1. Neonatal (7 days old) HCV-Tg or C57BL/6J wild-type mice were exposed to AFB1 (6 ug/g bw) or tricaprylin vehicle (15 ul/g bw) and male offspring were followed for up to 12 months.     No liver lesions were observed in vehicle-treated wild type or HCV-Tg mice.     Tumors (adenomas or carcinomas) and preneoplastic lesions (hyperplasia or foci) were observed in 22.5% (9 of 40) of AFB1-treated wild-type mice.     In HCV-Tg, the incidence of tumorous or pre-tumorous lesions was significantly elevated (50%, 18 of 36), with the difference largely due to a 2.5-fold increase in the incidence of adenomas (30.5% vs 12.5%). While oxidative stress and steato-hepatisis were observed in both AFB1-treated groups, molecular changes indicative of the enhanced inflammatory response and altered lipid metabolism were more pronounced in HCV-Tg mice.     In summary, HCV proteins core, E1, E2 and p7 are sufficient to reproduce the additive co-carcinogenic effect of HCV and AFB1 which is a known clinical phenomenon.     HCV transgenic mice (SL-139 strain, pAlbSVPA-HCV-S, containing the structural genes core, E1, E2, and p7, nucleotides 342-2771 of HCV genotype 1b, strain N, under the control of the murine albumin promoter/enhancer) on C57BL/6J (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) background were previously reported in Lerat et al (Lerat et al., Gastroenterology 122, 352-365, 2002). Transgenic animals were identified after weaning as detailed in Korenaga et al (Korenaga et al., J Biol.     Chem.     280, 37481-37488, 2005). Neonatal (7 days old) mice were administered a single dose of AFB1 (6 ug/g bw) or tricaprylin vehicle (15 ul/g bw) by intra-peritoneal injection.     Male mice were maintained on the regular animal chow with free access to food and water for up to 12 months.     All animal experiments were approved by the UNC Animal Care and Use Committee.     There were 20 liver samples used for microarray analysis (12 month time point). All samples were run in one batch.     There are 4 groups: WT/Control (4 samples - all biological replicates, i.e., different animals); WT/AFB1 (6 samples); HCV/Control (4 samples); HCV/AFB1 (6 samples). This was a 2 color design with a common reference mRNA. No dye swaps or replicate arrays were included.

 E-GEOD-43687 - LncRNAs expression profiles in the livers of C57Bl/6 mice after partial hepatectomy Liver regeneration has important implications because many therapeutic strategies for the surgical treatment of liver diseases, such as removal of liver tumors and liver transplantation, depend on the ability of the liver to regenerate physically and functionally.     Recent studies reported that lncRNAs control cell proliferation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the role of lncRNAs in liver regeneration and the overall mechanisms remain largely unknown.     To address this issue, we carried out a genome-wide lncRNA microarray analysis during liver regeneration in mice after 2/3 partial hepatectomy (PH) at various time points.     The results revealed differential expression of thousands of lncRNAs during liver regeneration.     Six-week-old male wildtype C57Bl/6 mouse liver samples were obtained at 0, 1.5, 12, and 24 hours after 2/3 PH, and three mice were analyzed for each time point.     Total RNA was isolated using Trizol.Mouse Stringent LncRNA Array (4 x 44K, ArrayStar, Rockville, MD) were used to monitor the expression level of approximately 14000 lncRNAs identified from the NCBI RefSeq, UCSC, RNAdb2.0, NRED, Fantom3.0 and UCRs. LncRNAs differentially expressed were identified by comparing expression levels during liver regeneration in mice after 2/3 partial hepatectomy (PH) at various time points.

 E-GEOD-25150 - MicroRNAs are Transported in Plasma and Delivered to Recipient Cells by High-Density Lipoproteins (Mouse HDL signatures from WT and LDLR-/- high fat diet) Circulating microRNAs (miRNA) are relatively stable in plasma and are a new class of disease biomarkers.     Here we present evidence that human high-density lipoprotein (HDL) transports endogenous miRNAs and delivers them to recipient cells with functional targeting capabilities.     Highly-purified fractions of human HDL contain small RNAs, and the HDL-miRNA profile from normal subjects is significantly different than familial hypercholesterolemia subjects.     miRNAs were demonstrated to associate with both native and reconstituted HDL particles, and reconstituted HDL injected into mice retrieved distinct miRNA profiles from normal and atherogenic models.     Cellular export of miRNAs to HDL was demonstrated to be regulated by neutral sphingomyelinase.     HDL-mediated delivery of miRNAs to recipient cells was demonstrated to be scavenger receptor BI-dependent.     Furthermore, HDL delivery of both exogenous and endogenous miRNAs resulted in the direct targeting of mRNA reporters.     Notably, HDL-miRNA from atherosclerotic subjects induced differential gene expression, with significant loss of conserved mRNA targets in cultured hepatocytes.     Collectively, these observations suggest that HDL participates in a novel mechanism of intercellular communication involving the transport and delivery of miRNAs.

 E-GEOD-19880 - Assessment of basal cell carcinoma and rhabdomyosarcoma tumorigenesis in Blm-deficient Ptch1+/- mice Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) have relative genomic stability and relatively benign clinical behavior but whether these two are related causally is unknown.      To investigate the effects of introducing genomic instability into murine BCCs, we have compared ionizing radiation-induced tumorigenesis in Ptch1+/- mice vs. that in Ptch1+/- mice carrying mutant Blm alleles.     We found that BCCs in Ptch1+/- Blmtm3Brd/tm3Brd mice had a trend towards greater genomic instability as measured by array CGH and that these mice developed significantly more microscopic BCCs than did Ptch1+/- Blm+/tm3Brd or Ptch1+/- Blm+/+ mice.     The mutant Blm alleles also markedly enhanced the formation of rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS), another cancer to which Ptch1+/- mice and PTCH1+/- (basal cell nevus syndrome) patients are susceptible.     Highly recurrent but different copy number changes were associated with the two tumor types and included losses of chromosomes 4 and 10 in all BCCs and gain of chromosome 10 in 80% of RMSs. Loss of chromosome 11 and 13, including the Trp53 and Ptch1 loci respectively, occurred frequently in BCCs, suggesting tissue-specific selection for genes or pathways that collaborate with Ptch deficiency in tumorigenesis.     Despite the quantitative differences, there was no dramatic qualitative difference in the BCC or RMS tumors associated with the mutant Blm genotype.     We investigated the effect of Blm deficiency on ionizing radiation-induced basal cell carcinoma and rhabdomyosarcoma tumorigenesis in Ptch1+/- mice.     Six BCC and five RMS samples were obtained from separate mice.     Liver tissue from each mouse was used as the normal reference.
 E-GEOD-12576 - Inducible expression of PrPC in mouse skeletal muscles results in myopathy characterized by changes in gene expression Over-expression of wild type PrP in skeletal muscles is sufficient to cause a primary myopathy with no signs of peripheral neuropathy, possibly due to accumulation of a cytotoxic truncated form of PrP and/or PrP aggregation.      In this study we used DNA microarrays to identify 1499 transcripts that are temporally deregulated concomitant with inducible PrPC over-expression in the skeletal muscles of transgenic mice.      Examination using microarrays revealed a transcriptional profile with both similarities and differences to previously investigated models of myopathies.      Down-regulation of genes coding for the myofibrillar proteins MYH2, MYH6, MYH7, MYL2, MYL3 and up-regulation of lysosomal genes CTSS, CTSD, CTSZ, DPEP2, HEXA, HEXB and LAMP1 coincide with the observed myopathy and lysosome accumulation on over-expression of PrPC.  Down-regulation of the MEF2C gene, a key regulatory transcriptional factor muscle development and remodeling of adult muscles in response to physiologic and pathologic signals, may contribute to the centrally placed nuclei in the skeletal muscles.      Significantly, up-regulation of genes involved in p53 signaling and the induction of p53 protein, suggest a central role for this molecule in the myopathy.      Several p53-regulated genes involved in cell cycle arrest (CDNK1A, GADD45a and GADD45b) and apoptosis (BAK1, PMAIP1, BBC3, and BAX) are induced.     We suggest that PrPC over-expression in skeletal muscles, possibly in response to accumulation of a cytotoxic truncated form of PrP, causes a primary myopathy involving the induction of p53-dependent pathways.      Wild type (WT), PrP-null (KO), and Tg(HQK) mice were fed food pellets either lacking or containing 6g doxycycline (Dox)/kg food to induce PrPC expression.     Skeletal muscles from the quadriceps of hind legs were removed at day 0, 4, 7, 14, 30 and 60 days following administration of Dox.  Total RNA was isolated from these tissues for use in subsequent microarray analysis.     Mouse gene expression was analysed by two-colour microarray experiments using an inhouse manufactured 16K mouse cDNA microarray.     Age matched reference mice (WT) and experimental (KO and HQK) Alexa Flour labeled aRNA were used in each competitive hybridization.      Each sample was labeled individually with both Alexa Fluor 555 and 647 for subsequent dye-swapped hybridizations to account for intensity bias.     3 individual mice from each experimental group at each time point were individually processed for separate microarrays.      We used the program EDGE to identify genes that were differentially expressed in mouse skeletal muscle in either transgenic HQK mice over expressing PrP, or PrP knock out (KO) mice  after administration of Dox.  We used a P value cut-off of 0.05 as the criteria of selection of significantly differentially expressed genes.

 E-GEOD-35815 - Maternal Influence on Exonic CpG Island Methylation in the Developing Hippocampus [HELP] Maternal 5-HT1A-receptor (R) is required for the timely development of the hippocampus and the establishment of emotional behaviors in Swiss-Webster (SW) mice.      A partial and/or complete loss of maternal 5-HT1AR results in delayed ventral dentate granule cell (v-DGC) development and subsequent anxiety-like phenotype in the wild-type offspring by a non-genetic, presumably epigenetic mechanism.      Here we tested v-DGCs for genome-wide DNA methylation changes elicited by the receptor deficient maternal environment.      We identified a set of hypomethylated regions in the offspring of receptor deficient mothers.      A significant fraction of these maternal-differentially methylated regions (m-DMRs) mapped to strong CpG islands, sequences that are typically not methylated or if methylated, resistant to environmental-induced changes.      Many m-DMRs mapped to exons and some were associated with expression changes.      Their hypomethylation was due to an arrest in de novo methylation and, to a lesser extent, to demethylation during postnatal life indicating that the perturbation in methylation coincides with the developmental delay in DGC maturation in the offspring of receptor deficient mothers.      Inhibiting methylation in differentiating neurons impaired their maturation further suggesting a link between de novo methylation and neuronal differentiation.      These data suggest that methylation at specific exonic CpG-islands may contribute to the mechanism through which maternal 5-HT1AR modulates hippocampal development and consecutively the level of anxiety in the SW offspring.      Reduced 5-HT1AR-binding has been reported in individuals, particularly in association with anxiety/depression, including peri/postpartum depression.      Therefore, maternal receptor deficit may contribute, via a non-genetic mechanism, to the high prevalence and heritability of anxiety disorders in human.     Comparison of methylation patterns in ventral Dentate Gyrus cells of wild type mice versus 5HT1A receptor knockouts, as well as the effect of the maternal 5HT1A genotype

 E-GEOD-40925 - Cooperativity of Rb, Brca1, and p53 and malignant breast cancer evolution (MFT121 p53f/f Brca1f/f) Breast cancers that are “triple-negative” for the clinical markers ESR1, PGR, and HER2 typically belong to the Basal-like molecular subtype.     Defective Rb, p53, and Brca1 pathways are each associated with triple-negative and Basal-like subtypes.     Our mouse genetic studies demonstrate that the combined inactivation of Rb and p53 pathways is sufficient to suppress the physiological cell death of mammary involution.     Furthermore, concomitant inactivation of all three pathways in mammary epithelium has an additive effect on tumor latency and predisposes highly penetrant, metastatic adenocarcinomas.     The tumors are poorly differentiated and have histologic features that are common among human Brca1-mutated tumors, including heterogeneous morphology, metaplasia, and necrosis.     Gene expression analyses demonstrate that the tumors share attributes of both Basal-like and Claudin-low signatures, two molecular subtypes encompassed by the broader, triple-negative class defined by clinical markers.     These studies establish a unique animal model of aggressive forms of breast cancer for which there are no effective, targeted treatments.     Rb, p53, and Brca1 are associated with inherited forms of cancer, but defects in these pathways are also found together in a subset of breast cancer patients without a family history of the disease.     Simultaneous inactivation of all three pathways causes more aggressive disease than do pair-wise combinations, indicating that the pathways play non-overlapping roles in tumor prevention.     We investigated the effect of perturbation of Rb family pathways, p53, and/or Brca1 in mouse mammary epithelium.     Eighteen tumors were compared to normal spleen DNA.
 E-GEOD-5379 - Transcription profiling of mouse C3H10T1/2 cells treated with Glis3 identifies its role in osteoblast differentiation and adipocyte differentiation The expression of Glis3 in C3H10T1/2 cells promotes osteoblastic differentiation as indicated by the the induction of increase in alkaline phosphatase activity, an early marker of osteoblast differentiation, and increased expression of osteopontin, a late marker of osteogenesis.     Glis3 acts synergistically with bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP-2). In contrast, expression of Glis3 inhibits the induction of adipocyte differentiation.     Microarray analysis identified the fibroblast growth factor 18 (FGF18) as one of the genes induced by Glis3 in C3H10T1/2 cells directly.      Experiment Overall Design: Total RNA was extracted from C3H10T1/2 cells infected with empty vector or Glis3 using Qiagen Rneasy Mini kit.      Each RNA sample was amplified and converted to fluorescently labeled cRNA, either with cyanine 3 (Cy3) or cyanine 5 (Cy5), using the Agilent Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit. The fluorescently labeled cRNAs were mixed and hybridized simultaneously to Agilent mouse oligo arrays.     The sample pair was hybridized to two arrays, employing a fluor reversal.     Chips were scanned with an Agilent dual-laser scanner.      Gene expression data were generated using the Agilent feature extraction software (v7.5), with defaults for all parameters.

 E-GEOD-11197 - Suppression of LPS-induced IFNg and NO in splenocytes by select E2-regulated miRNA: A novel mechanism of immune mod. microRNA (miRNA), recently identified, non-coding, small RNA, are emerging as key regulators in homeostasis of the immune system.      Therefore, aberrant expression of miRNA may be linked to immune dysfunction, such as in chronic inflammation and autoimmunity.      In this study, we investigated the potential role of miRNA in estrogen-mediated regulation of innate immune responses, as indicated by upregulation of LPS-induced IFNg, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and nitric oxide in splenic lymphocytes from estrogen-treated mice.      We found that miR-146a, a negative regulator of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, was decreased in freshly-isolated splenic lymphocytes from estrogen-treated mice compared to placebo controls.      Increasing the activity of miR-146a significantly inhibited LPS-induced IFNg and iNOS expression in mouse splenic lymphocytes.      Further, miRNA microarray and Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that estrogen selectively upregulates/downregulates the expression of miRNA in mouse splenic lymphocytes.      miR-223, which is highly upregulated by estrogen, regulates LPS-induced IFNg, but not iNOS or nitric oxide in splenic lymphocytes.     Inhibition of miR-223 activity decreased LPS-induced IFNg in splenic lymphocytes from estrogen-treated mice.     Our data are the first demonstrating selective regulation of miRNA expression in immune cells by estrogen and are indicative of an important role of miRNA in estrogen-mediated immune regulation.      Keywords:  microRNAs, estrogen, splenic lymphocytes, TLR4 signaling, mouse Total RNAs were isolated from freshly-isolated splenic lymphocytes from 2 pairs of placebo-and estrogen-treated mice
 E-GEOD-11596 - Gene expression profiles of wild type and Mecp2-null mice in three different regions of the brain Background.     Rett syndrome (RTT) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is one of the most frequent causes of mental retardation in women.     A great landmark in research in this field was the discovery of a relationship between the disease and the presence of mutations in the gene that codes for the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Currently, MeCP2 is thought to act as a transcriptional repressor that couples DNA methylation and transcriptional silencing.     The present study aimed to identify new target genes directly regulated by Mecp2 in a mouse model of RTT. Methodology.     We have compared the gene expression profiles of wild type (WT) and Mecp2-null (KO) mice in three regions of the brain (cortex, midbrain, and cerebellum) by using cDNA microarrays.     The results obtained were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Subsequent chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed seven direct target genes of Mecp2 bound in vivo (Dlk1, Mobp, Plagl1, Ddc, Mllt2h, Eya2, and S100a9), and two overexpressed genes due to an indirect effect of a lack of Mecp2 (Irak1 and Prodh). Bisulfite sequencing analysis of the methylation patterns of promoters of the described genes showed no differences between WT and KO mice, demonstrating that methylation differences were not the cause of the observed expression changes.     Moreover, the regions bound by Mecp2 were always methylated, suggesting the involvement of the methyl-CpG binding domain of the protein in the mechanism of interaction.     Conclusions.     We identified new genes that are overexpressed in KO mice and are excellent candidate genes for involvement in various features of the neurodevelopmental disease.     Our results demonstrate new targets of MeCP2 and provide us with a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of RTT. Comparative experiment: Mecp2-null (KO) mice vs. their corresponding age-mated wild type (WT) littermates (CONTROLS). Four couples of KO-WT animals are used and three different brain regions are studied from each couple; cortex, midbrain, and cerebellum.

 E-GEOD-15843 - Functional genomic analysis of frataxin deficiency, Agilent data Functional genomic analysis of frataxin deficiency reveals tissue-specific alterations and identifies the PPARγ pathway as a therapeutic target in Friedreich's ataxia  Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), the most common inherited ataxia, is characterized by focal neurodegeneration, diabetes mellitus, and life-threatening cardiomyopathy.     Frataxin, which is significantly reduced in patients with this recessive disorder, is a mitochondrial iron-binding protein, but how its deficiency leads to neurodegeneration and metabolic derangements is not known.     We performed microarray analysis of heart and skeletal muscle in a mouse model of frataxin deficiency, and found molecular evidence of increased lipogenesis in skeletal muscle, and alteration of fiber-type composition in heart, consistent with insulin resistance and cardiomyopathy, respectively.     Since the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) pathway is known to regulate both processes, we hypothesized that dysregulation of this pathway could play a key role in frataxin deficiency.     We confirmed this by showing a coordinate dysregulation of the PPARγ coactivator Pgc1a and transcription factor Srebp1 in cellular and animal models of frataxin deficiency, and in cells from FRDA patients, who have marked insulin resistance.     Finally, we show that genetic modulation of the PPARγ pathway affects frataxin levels in vitro, supporting PPARγ as a novel therapeutic target in FRDA. To compare frataxin deficient (KIKO) mice vs. WT, heart and skeletal muscle.     Three replicates (KIKO vs WT), with dye swap
 E-GEOD-48201 - Inducing pluripotency from mouse somatic cells by small-molecule compounds [Phalanx Mouse OneArray] Pluripotent stem cells can be induced from somatic cells, providing an unlimited cell resource for regenerative medicine.     However, genetic manipulation and difficult-to-manufacture strategies used in reprogramming limit their clinical applications.     Here, we show pluripotency can be induced from mouse somatic cells by specific small-molecule compounds.     The completely chemically-induced pluripotent stem cells (CiPSCs) can be stably maintained in embryonic stem cell (ESC) culture medium and resemble ESCs in terms of their gene expression profiles, epigenetic status, and potential for differentiation and germline transmission.     These findings suggest that exogenous master genes are dispensable for cell fate reprogramming and pave the way for the clinical application of somatic reprogramming techniques.

 E-GEOD-70516 - miRNA expression of livers of liver-specific Hnf4a-null (Hnf4aΔH) mice Of 610 miRNAs, expression of 24 and 19 miRNAs was down-regulated or up-regulated more than 2-fold in Hnf4aΔH mice as compared to control (Hnf4af/f) mice In the study presented here, in order to identifiy the target genes for hepatic HNF4a, hepatic expression profiles of a total of 610 unique miRNA genes in Hnf4aΔH mice were investigated as compared with Hnf4af/f mice
 E-GEOD-38596 - Genome-wide maps of cytosine methylation, cytosine hydroxylmethylation and small non coding RNAs in mouse ES cells and upon guided differentiation to mesoendoderm cells Genome-wide maps of cytosine methylation, cytosine hydroxylmethylation and small non coding RNAs in mouse ES cells and upon guided differentiation to mesoendoderm cells.     Mouse embryonic stem cells (E14) were guided differentiated into mesoendoderm lineages by activin-A induction.     cells in three time points (day0, day4 and day6) were collected.     The genome-wide studies on three cell types were summerized as following: cytosine methylation data were generated using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (MeDIP-seq) and DNA digestion by methyl-sensitive restriction enzymes followed by sequencing (MRE-seq); DNA product for 5-hmC ChIP-seq is generated by a selctive chemical labeling method (Nat. Biotechnol.     2011, 29, 68-72). E14 Day0 data for MRE-seq and MeDIP-seq are released first in previous publication and included in prior series GSE36114 ChIP-seq, 5-hmC-seq, MeDIP-Seq, MRE-Seq, ncRNA-Seq, and RNA-seq on activin-induced differentiating ES cells at 3 time points.

 E-GEOD-12580 - Transcription profiling of mouse wild type embryonic stem cells after blastocytst injection revealglobal corrections in MDX mice. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an incurable neuromuscular degenerative disease, caused by a mutation in the dystrophin gene.     Mdx mice recapitulate DMD features.     Here we show that injection of wild-type  (WT) embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into mdx blastocysts produces mice with improved pathology.     A small fraction of WT ESCs incorporates into the mdx mouse nonuniformly to upregulate protein levels of dystrophin in the skeletal muscle.     The chimeric muscle shows reduced regeneration and restores dystrobrevin, a dystrophin-related protein, in areas with high and with low dystrophin content.     WT ESC injection also normalizes the amount of fat, a tissue that does not express dystrophin.     ESC injection without dystrophin does not prevent the appearance of phenotypes in the skeletal muscle or in the fat.     Thus, dystrophin supplied by the ESCs reverses disease in mdx mice globally.      Experiment Overall Design: 3-week old mdx (C57BL/10ScSn-Dmdmdx/J, Jax labs) females were superovulated and mated with mdx males (Jax labs). Blastocysts were collected at 3.5 days afer mating, injected with 15 WT or mdx R26 ES cells.     Injected blastocysts were then transferred into the uteri of pseudopregnant females and allowed to develop to term.     Skeletal muscle from 4 month old chimeric male mice was collected, RNA was isolated and microarray analysis were performed.
 E-GEOD-56853 - Arid3a modulates the first cell fate decision by direct regulation of both embryonic and extraembryonic gene expression (microarray) Arid3a, a transcription factor known for its requirement in B-lymphocyte development, has been recently identified as a member of ES cell pluripotency network.     Arid3a is moderately expressed in ES cells, and its expression is gradually increased during differentiation.     Since Arid3a shows the highest expression in placenta, we hypothesized that Arid3a may play important roles in TE development.     We report that Arid3a is a central regulator of both TE-specific and pluripotency-associated gene expression during ES cell differentiation.     While dispensable for self-renewal, we observed that knockdown of Arid3a delays differentiation of ES cells.     Induction of Arid3a leads ES cells to promote differentiation, specifically towards TE lineage.     Moreover, these Arid3a-overexpressing cells maintained in TE culture media are sufficient to generate functional trophoblast stem-like cells, suggesting roles of Arid3a in TE differentiation.     By integrative analyses using the chromosomal targets of Arid3a with expression profiling, we revealed the dual roles of Arid3a, as a direct activator of TE-specific genes and a repressor of pluripotency-associated genes.     We further revealed the repressive roles of Arid3a are mediated by histone deacetylases (HDACs). Taken together, our results demonstrate that Arid3a is a critical novel regulator in TE lineage specification.     Arid3a overexpression and Arid3a knockdown Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using RNeasy plus mini kit (Qiagen). cDNA were synthesized and labelled, followed by hybridization on Affymetrix GeneChip mouse genome 430A 2.0 arrays.
 E-GEOD-67415 - Ebf1 heterozygosity results in increased DNA damage in pro-B cells and their synergistic transformation by Pax5 haploinsufficiency Ebf1 is a transcription factor with documented, and dose dependent, functions in both normal and malignant B-lymphocyte development.     In order to understand more about the role of Ebf1 in malignant transformation, we have investigated the impact of reduced functional Ebf1 dose on early B-cell progenitors.     Gene expression analysis in loss and gain of function analysis suggested that Ebf1 was involved in the regulation of genes of importance for DNA repair as well as cell survival.     Investigation of the level of DNA damage in steady state as well as after induction of DNA damage by UV light supported that pro-B cells lacking one functional allele of Ebf1 display a reduced ability to repair DNA damage.     This was correlated to a reduction in expression of Rad51 and combined analysis of published 4C and chromatin Immuno precipitation data suggested that this gene is a direct target for Ebf1. Even though the lack of one allele of Ebf1 did not result in any dramatic increase of tumor formation, we noted a dramatic increase in the formation of pro-B cell leukemia in mice carrying a combined heterozygote mutation in the Ebf1 and Pax5 genes.     Even though the tumors were phenotypically similar and stable, we noted a large degree of molecular heterogeneity well in line with a mechanism involving impaired DNA repair.     Our data support the idea that Ebf1 controls homologous DNA repair in a dose dependent manner and that this may explain the frequent involvement of Ebf1 in human leukemia 230238: Briefly, 230238 preB-cell line was infected with pMIG-Ebf1-engrailed or pMIG-control (empty vector). Cells were GFP sorted and 500.000 cells were resuspended in RLT for subsequent RNA-extraction.     Analysis were perfomred in triplicate.     FL Ebf1-KO: E14.5 fetal liver (FL) Ebf1-/- were isolated and expanded expanded in vitro on OP9 stroma cells on conditions permissive for B-cell development.     Expanded cells were infected with pMIG-Ebf1-ER and sorted on GFP. Cells were reseeded on OP9 stroma cells and tamoxifen was added to a final concentration of 0.1 uM. 500.000 cells were harvested and RNA extracted 0, 6, 12 and 24h. Gene expression levels were compared to 0h and analysis were performed in duplicates.     Tumor LNs: Enlarged lymphnodes from approximately 30 weeks old C57BL/6 Ebf1+/-Pax5+/-  were dissected, homogenized and live frozen.     After thawing, 1 million lymphnodes cells were live sorted and  resuspended in RLT prior to RNA extraction.     8 samples were analyzed in duplicates.     1 million proB cells from wt C57BL/6 were sorted and used as controls.
 E-GEOD-18788 - miRNA profiling from freshly harvested duodenums and livers This SuperSeries is composed of the following subset Series: GSE18774: miRNA profiling from freshly harvested duodenums GSE18775: miRNA profiling from freshly harvested livers Refer to individual Series
 E-GEOD-34618 - Expression data from CD8+ Central memory T cells after different time periods of Concanavalin A  in vitro activation. CD8+ tumor infiltrating T cells (TIL) lack effector-phase functions due to defective proximal TCR-mediated signaling shown to result from inactivation of p56lck kinase.     We identify a novel interacting partner for p56lck in nonlytic TIL, Protocadherin-18 (‘pcdh18’), and show that pcdh18 is transcribed upon in vitro or in vivo activation of CD8+ central memory T cells (CD44+CD62LhiCD127+) coincident with conversion into effector memory cells (CD44+CD62LloCD127+). Expression of pcdh18 in primary CD8+ effector cells induces the phenotype of nonlytic TIL: defective; proximal TCR signaling, cytokine secretion, and cytolysis; and enhanced AICD. pcdh18 contains a motif (centered at Y505) shared with src kinases (QGQYQP) which is required for the inhibitory phenotype.     Thus, pcdh18 is a novel marker of CD8+ effector memory T cells expressed upon cell activation that can function as a negative regulator by restricting the effector phase.     We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying CD8+ 'Central memory' T cells activation and identified distinct transcriptional pattern clusters.     Ten spleens were pooled from 62 week old C57BL/6 male mice and enriched for CD8+ T cells by negative selection using a cocktail of biotinylated antibodies to deplete CD4, CD11c, CD11b, MHC-II, B220, and NK cells.      Cells were then stained for CD8, CD44, CD62L, and CD127 and sorted (using a iCyt Reflection parallel cell sorter). Cells were collected and cultured (0.5 x106 cells/well) in 10% complete RPMI media supplemented with 0.005 ugr Con A and RNA prepared using TRIZOL and the 'RNeasy clean-up kit' (Invitrogen) after activation for different times.       We established single transcriptional profiles for 6 time points after T cell activation (4, 6, 8, 16, 20, 24 h) including a control zero h time point (prior to activation). RNA was isolated by standard procedures and its quality was assessed by the NYU Center for Health Informatics and Bioinformatics.     cDNAs were hybridized to GeneSpring arrays using the mouse genome MOE430 2.0 array (Affymetrix) which interrogates ~45,000 transcripts.
 E-GEOD-22409 - Inhibition of histone deacetylase activity interferes with innate immune responses and protects from severe sepsis Sensing of microbial products by innate immune cells skew their transcriptional program to optimize anti-microbial defences.     Chromatin remodeling by histone deacetylases (HDACs) plays a fundamental role in tailoring gene expression.     HDAC inhibitors are among the most promising anti-cancer drugs and possess intrinsic anti-inflammatory properties.     Yet, the influence of HDAC inhibition on innate immune responses to microbial infection is unknown.     Here we show that HDAC inhibitors repress the expression of less than 10% of the genes expressed at baseline in BM-derived macrophages.     In sharp contrast, HDAC inhibitors strongly interfere with transcriptome remodeling induced by LPS and Pam3CSK4, affecting the expression of 30-70% of genes modulated by microbial stimuli.     Strikingly, HDAC inhibitors target the expression of numerous genes involved in anti-microbial host defences, encoding for microbial sensors, cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and their receptors, adhesion and signaling molecules, and molecules involved in antigen processing and presentation.     At the molecular level, HDAC inhibitors do not impair mitogen-activated protein kinase, NF-kB, interferon-related factor signal and STAT1 transduction pathways, but inhibit NF-kB p65 recruitment to the promoter region of HDAC inhibitor-sensitive genes.     HDAC inhibitors also inhibit the response of mouse and human DCs, splenocytes and whole blood to a broad range of microbial products and microorganisms.     In agreement with these in vitro findings, HDAC inhibitors increase bacterial burden and sensitize mice to sub-lethal infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans.     Conversely, HDAC inhibitors confer protection in models of Pam3CSK4-induced fulminant toxic shock and severe sepsis following cecal ligation and puncture.     Overall, these data substantiate the concept of immunomodulation by HDAC inhibitors, and suggest that these drugs could represent efficacious adjunctive therapy of severe sepsis.     Mus musculus cells were grown in presence of LPS or LPS + TSA and pam or pam + TSA and hybrydised against a cRNA pool UMRR (from Mus musculus cells).
 E-GEOD-13782 - Identification of spondylarthropathy-specific genes in BALB/c mice with proteoglycan-induced spondylitis (PGIS) BALB/c mice develop peripheral arthritis (PGIA) and spondyloarthropathy (PGIS) upon repeated intraperitoneal injections of human cartilage proteoglycan (PG) aggrecan.     The aim of the present study was to identify spondylitis-specific genes by comparing intervertebral disc (IVD) RNA samples from spondyloarthropathic and naïve BALB/c mice.      Keywords: Genetic modification We compared the gene expression data of 5 spondyloarthropathic and 3 naïve (control) mice.
 E-GEOD-7764 - Transcription profiling of mouse resting and IL-15 activated natural killer cells Murine NK cells were compared at rest and following 24 hours of IL-15 stimulation for their mRNA expression profiles on the Affymetrix MOE430 2 microarray platform.      Additional comparators included resting bulk splenocytes.     Experiment Overall Design: Three pairs of flow sorted murine NK cells (C57Bl/6) were analzyed at rest or after 24 hours of IL-15 stimulation.      Three biological replicates of each condition (resting or IL-15) are included in this anlaysis.      In addition, bulk resting splenocytes were used (2 biological replicates with 2 chip replicates for a total of 4 replicates).
 E-GEOD-20645 - Transcription profiling by array of mouse oligodendrocyte precursor cells cultured at 31.5 degC and 37 degC We have found that the cell yield of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are higher in 31.5 degC than in 37 degC not by suppression of apoptosis but by enhancement of proliferation.     Here, we performed transcriptome analysis using Affymetrix GeneChip on the primary cultured oligodendrocyte precursor cells prepared from the brain of ICR mice.     Oligodendrocyte precursor cells were prepared from primary mixed cell cultures of embryonic mouse cerebral hemispheres.     The cerebral hemispheres from 15-day-old mouse embryos were enzymatically dissociated, seeded and cultured for 5 days in D-MEM containing 10% FBS. The cells were passaged to serum-free basal medium and cultured for further 48 hr at 37 degC and 31.5 degC.
 E-GEOD-73037 - Cross-species Gene Expression Analysis Identifies a Novel Set of Genes Implicated in Human Insulin Sensitivity This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.     Refer to individual Series
 E-GEOD-33761 - Gene expression in adipose tissue of intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) and Macrosomic animals that developed in a crowded uterine horn Animals that are growth restricted in utero may show rapid postnatal growth that ultimately results in adult obesity.      Macrosomic animals at birth typically remain large and are also obese as adults.      Our goal was to examine the differences between animals that reach obesity in different ways.      We also aimed to examine gene expression in animals that start out lean and stay lean compared to those that start out lean and become fat.     We used microarrays to detail gene expression in adipose tissue.     3 samples each from IUGR animals with rapid postnatal growth (IH), IUGR animals with slower postnatal growth (IL), and macromsomic animals (M).
 E-GEOD-63759 - Expression profile of COUP-TFII overexpressing hearts Increased COUP-TFII levels are found in human dilated cardiomyopathy as well as in mouse models that develop cardiomyopathy.     COUP-TFII overexpression in adult mouse hearts caused ventricular dilation and compromised cardiac functions.     To gain insights on COUP-TFII’s effect in hearts, we identified the molecular profile of COUP-TFII overexpressing hearts through microarray analysis.     The result may shred light on molecular mechanisms that mediate development of dilated cardiomyopathy.     We utilized a previously established CAG-S-COUP-TFII allele and crossed it with the Myh6-MerCreMer (Myh6-MCM) line to overexpress COUP-TFII specifically in cardiomyocytes at two months of age by administration of tamoxifen.     The experimental group has genotype of Myh6-MCM; CAG-S-COUP-TFII while the control group consists of Myh6-MCM mice (Figure 1C). Whole ventricles were harvested 16 days post induction for molecular profiling.
 E-GEOD-9969 - Physiological functions of the RORs in brown adipose tissue To determine the physiological targets of the RORs in brown adipose tissue.     Keywords: Nuclear receptors, RORs, adipose Gene expression analysis was conducted using Agilent whole mouse genome arrays (012694). The analysis was perfomed in duplicate, employing a fluor reversal.     RNA was isolated from interscapular brown adipose tissue from C57BL/6 male WT or DKO (RORa-/- and RORg-/-) 8-12 week old mice around circadian time 20. Total RNA was amplified using the Agilent Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit protocol.      Starting with 500ng of total RNA, Cy3 or Cy5 labeled cRNA was produced according to manufacturer’s protocol.      For each two color comparison, 750ng of each Cy3 and Cy5 labeled cRNAs were mixed and fragmented using the Agilent In Situ Hybridization Kit protocol.      Hybridizations were performed for 17 hours in a rotating hybridization oven using the Agilent 60-mer oligo microarray processing protocol.      Slides were washed as indicated in this protocol and then scanned with an Agilent Scanner.      Data were retrieved with the Agilent Feature Extraction software (v7.5), using defaults for all parameters.     The Agilent Feature Extraction Software performed error modeling, adjusting for additive and multiplicative noise.      The resulting data were processed using the Rosetta Resolver® system (Rosetta Biosoftware, Kirkland, WA).
 E-GEOD-15999 - Transcription profiling of mouse pneumonectomy vs. sham treated time course to identify mesenchymal signature of post-pneumonectomy lung regeneration in adult mice The adult human lung has a very limited capacity to regenerate functional alveoli.     In contrast, adult mice have a remarkable capacity for neoalveolarization following either lung resection or injury.     The molecular basis for this unique capability to regenerate lung tissue in mice is largely unknown.     We examined the transcriptomic responses to single lung pneumonectomy in adult mice in order to elucidate prospective molecular signaling used in this species during lung regeneration.     Unilateral left pneumonectomy or sham thoracotomy was performed under general anesthesia (n = 8 mice per group for each of the four time points). Total RNA was isolated from the remaining lung tissue at four time points post-surgery (6 hours, 1 day, 3 days, 7 days) and analyzed using microarray technology.     The observed transcriptomic patterns revealed mesenchymal cell signaling, including up-regulation of genes previously associated with activated fibroblasts (Tnfrsf12a, Tnc, Eln, Col3A1), as well as modulation of Igf1-mediated signaling.     The data set also revealed early down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine transcripts, up-regulation of genes involved in T cell development and function, but few similarities to transcriptomic patterns observed during embryonic or post-natal lung development.     Immunohistochemical analysis suggests that early fibroblast but not myofibroblast proliferation is important during lung regeneration and may explain the preponderance of mesenchymal-associated genes that are over-expressed in this model.       This appears to differ from embryonic alveologenesis.      These data suggest that modulation of mesenchymal cell signaling and proliferation may act in concert with immunomodulation to control inflammation during post-pneumonectomy lung regeneration in adult mice.     Experiment Overall Design: For each of the four time points (6 hr, 1 day, 3 day, 7 day), the mice were divided into two groups: (1) pneumonectomy (PNY) and (2) sham operated (SHAM - thoracotomy without lung resection), with eight animals in each group.     One microarray was performed on pooled lung tissue from these 8 animals for each time point.      Analysis of expression in PNY vs SHAM animals was performed in two ways: using all four microarrays as replicates in a time-independent analysis, as well as analysis of each time point separately (time-dependent) without replicates.
 E-GEOD-19306 - Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) in mice transduced in utero with feline immunodeficiency virus-based vectors (expression) Fetal mice (16 days gestation) were administered feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-based lentiviral viral particles containing the gene encoding GFP.  Six liver tumors developed in three mice between the ages of 273 and 484 days, each mouse developed 2 tumors.     These tumors and non-tumorous liver tissue from the same animals and animals that did not develop tumors and untransduced controls were harvested and microarrays were performed on total RNA extracted from these samples.     We were interested in investigating the link between lentiviral integration and gene expression.      Keywords: Comparison of HCC with non-tumorous liver tissue adjacent to tumor.     Fourteen samples were analyzed in total: Two tumors from each of three mice (6 samples); surrounding non-tumorous liver tissue from each of these three mice (3 samples); two female mice and one male mouse that were transduced and did not develop tumors (3 samples); one female and one male untransduced mouse (2 samples). The samples were performed in two runs: one containing the samples from female mice and the second containing samples from male mice.
 E-GEOD-15078 - Transcription profiling of mouse Fog2flox/delta; MHCaCre vs. Fog2flox/deltaFog2 to investigate Fog2 regulation of gene expression in the adult heart MHCaCre induced knockout of Fog2flox.      Aberrant transcriptional regulation contributes to the pathogenesis of both congenital and adult forms of heart disease.     While the transcriptional regulator FOG2 is known to be essential for heart morphogenesis and coronary development, its tissue specific function has not been previously investigated.     Additionally, little is known about the role of FOG2 in the adult heart.     Here we use spatiotemporally regulated inactivation of Fog2 to delineate its function both in embryo and adult heart.     Early cardiomyocyte-restricted loss of Fog2 recapitulated the cardiac and coronary defects of the Fog2 germline knockouts.     Later cardiomyocyte-restricted loss of Fog2 (Fog2MC) did not result in defects in cardiac structure or coronary vessel formation.     However, Fog2MC adult mice had severely depressed ventricular function and died at 8-14 weeks.     Fog2MC adult hearts displayed a paucity of coronary vessels.     This was associated with myocardial hypoxia, increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and cardiac fibrosis.     Induced inactivation of Fog2 in adult heart resulted in similar phenotype, as did ablation of FOG2 interaction with the transcription factor GATA4. Loss of FOG2 or FOG2-GATA4 interaction altered expression of a panel of angiogenesis-related genes.     Collectively, our data indicated that FOG2 regulates adult heart function and coronary angiogenesis.              Experiment Overall Design: Fog2flox/delta; MHCaCre (3) compared to Fog2flox/delta; no Cre (3). One heart per sample.
 E-GEOD-58822 - TMPRSS2 Influences Prostate Cancer Metastasis TMPRSS2 is an androgen-regulated cell surface serine protease expressed predominantly in prostate epithelium.     TMPRSS2 is expressed highly in localized high-grade prostate cancers and in the majority of human prostate cancer metastasis.     Through the generation of mouse models with a targeted deletion of Tmprss2, we demonstrate that the activity of this protease regulates cancer cell invasion and metastasis to distant organs.     By screening combinatorial peptide libraries we identified a spectrum of TMPRSS2 substrates that include pro-hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). HGF activated by TMPRSS2 promoted c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, and initiated a pro-invasive EMT phenotype.     Chemical library screens identified a potent bioavailable TMPRSS2 inhibitor that suppressed prostate cancer metastasis in vivo.     Together, these findings provide a mechanistic link between androgen-regulated signaling programs and prostate cancer metastasis that operate via context-dependent interactions with extracellular constituents of the tumor microenvironment.     Custom mouse cDNA microarrays were used to measure transcript levels in microdissected anterior prostate tumors from Tmprss2+/+;TRAMP mice, Tmprss2-/-;TRAMP mice or strain-matched benign epithelium.     All samples were laser-capture microdissected and total RNA isolated and amplified prior to hybridization against a reference pool of normal adult mouse tissues.
 E-GEOD-11125 - Transcription profiling of mouse liver after 4.5 days of repeated combined acoustic and restraint stress vs. control Stress is a powerful modulator of neuroendocrine, behavioral and immunological functions.     After 4.5 days of repeated combined acoustic and restraint stress as a murine model of chronic psychological stress severe metabolic dysregulations became detectable in female BALB/c mice.     Stress-induced alterations of metabolic processes that were found in a hepatic mRNA expression profiling were verified by in vivo analyses.     Repeatedly stressed mice developed a hypermetabolic syndrome with severe loss of lean body mass, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, increased amino acid turn-over, and acidosis.     This was associated with hypercortisolism, hyperleptinemia, insulin resistance, and hypothyroidism.     In contrast, after a single acute stress exposure changes in expression of metabolic genes were much less pronounced and predominantly confined to gluconeogenesis, probably indicating that metabolic disturbances might be initiated already early but will only manifest in repeatedly stressed mice .Thus, in our murine model, repeated stress caused severe metabolic dysregulations leading to a drastic reduction of the individual’s energy reserves.     Under such circumstances stress may further reduce the ability to cope with new stressors such as infection or cancer.     Endocrinology Epub ahead of print, March 11, 2008;  doi:10.1210/en.2008-0038 Experiment Overall Design: Two biological experiments of repeated combined acoustic and restraint stress were performed, which consist each of a repeatedly stressed group and an untreated control group.     Liver RNA expression profiles were analyzed in technical duplicates using pools of 8 or 9 individual RNAs of each group.
 E-GEOD-17647 - Transcription profiling of human pancreatic beta cells reveals the involvement of 4E-BP1 in the protection induced by HDLs High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) protect pancreatic β cells against apoptosis.     This property might be related to the increased risk to develop diabetes in patients with low HDL blood levels.     However, the mechanisms by which HDLs protect β cells are poorly characterized.     Here we use a transcriptomic approach to identify genes differentially modulated by HDLs in β cells subjected to apoptotic stimuli.     Experiment Overall Design: Tested conditions on beta-TC3 cells for 6h (in triplicates for each condition; GSK3 and GSK4 indicate two independent HDL preparations): Experiment Overall Design: Complete Medium + Vehicle [V] Experiment Overall Design: Complete Medium + HDL (prep.     HDL GSK3 or HDL GSK4) [HDL] Experiment Overall Design: Starvation medium + Vehicle [V.S] Experiment Overall Design: Starvation medium + HDL (prep.     HDL GSK3 or HDL GSK4) [HDL.S]
 E-GEOD-18395 - Expression data from mouse adult fibroblasts with  Rb deletion and/or p53DD expression exposed to cisplatin (CDDP) The RB and p53 tumor suppressor pathways regulate the transcription of genes involved in cell cycle progression, DNA replication, DNA repair, and apoptosis.     These tumor suppressors are critical modulators of the response to genotoxic damage and both pathways are frequently inactivated in human cancers.     We used microarrays to monitor gene expression patterns upon exposure to cisplatin treatment in fibroblasts harboring loss/inactivation of RB and/or p53. We generated mouse adult fibroblasts harboring loss/inactivation of RB and/or p53 and subjected these cell populations to cisplatin treatment for 24 hours.     Treated cell populations were allowed to recover from cisplatin exposure, generating a recurred cell popuation.     Untreated and recurred cell populations were then subjected to RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
 E-GEOD-33885 - The role of transcription factor Gata4 Using a systems biology approach, we discovered and dissected a three-way interaction between the immune system, the intestinal epithelium, and the microbiota.     We found that mice lacking B lymphocytes, or lacking IgA, have low intestinal expression of lipid metabolism genes regulated by the transcription factor GATA4, and a consequent decrease in fat absorption in the intestine.      The defect disappeared in germ free mice, suggesting that it is dependent on the microbiota; and sequencing analysis of the bacteria showed subtle differences between normal and B-cell deficient mice.     Analysis of gene expression of gut biopsies from patients with common variable immunodeficiency and intestinal dysfunction revealed a high similarity to mouse B-cell knockout profiles.     These data provide an explanation for a longstanding enigmatic association between immunodeficiency and defective lipid absorption in humans.     This series represents the subsection of the study where we address the role of transcription factor Gata4. The data are from conditional KO (Gata4KOvil) and  corresponding control mice.     Intensity of each channel was extracted from two-color arrays.      We used direct dye swap design and performed paired analysis between small intestine of KO and control mice.     Corresponding paires of KO and control were hybridized on the same array, except pair X
 E-GEOD-12591 - Angiotensin II induced aneurysms in male ApoE mice In this study we used microarrays to examine relative genes expression within the aorta of ApoE-/- infused with angiotensin II in relation to aneurysm formation.     Infusion of angiotensin II induces aortic dilatation particularly of the suprarenal aorta in ApoE-/- mice.     Based on studies carried out in our and other laboratories the response to angiotensin II is variable, with some mice developing large aneurysms but other animals appearing resistant to aneurysm formation with aortic diameters similar to that of saline controls.         We compared RNA expression from whole aortas of 17 week old male ApoE-/- mice exposed to angiotensin II (1.44 µg/kg/min) for 4 weeks where there was clear evidence of aortic aneurysm formation (n=5) with that of mice failing to develop aneurysms (n=7) and those exposed to saline infusion (n=6). AAA was defined as diameter of suprarenal aorta greated than 1.5mm measured on photographs of aortas at necroscopy.       Keywords: Disease state analysis 18 samples analysed, AAA (n=5), no AAA (n=7), saline (n=6). AAA - abdominal aortic aneurysm
 E-GEOD-10525 - Transcription profiling of mouse transgenic adenocarcinoma of the prostate (TRAMP) Gene expression profile of Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) reveals murine targets for preclinical development of human prostate cancer therapy; In this study, we have generated an open source TRAMP microarray dataset to identify differentially expressed genes from human prostate cancer that have concordant expression in TRAMP tumors, and thereby represent lead targets for preclinical therapy development.     Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 chips were used for microarrays of total RNA from 9 TRAMP tumors and 9 normal prostates (ventral and dorsolateral lobes). Experiment Overall Design: normal prostate vs. TRAMP
 E-GEOD-55177 - Ataxin-2 adapts ribosomal mRNA levels and S6 phosphorylation to nutrient availability, with effects on protein synthesis and growth Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is a neurodegenerative disorder, which is caused by an unstable CAG-repeat expansion in the SCA2 gene, that encodes a polyglutamine tract (polyQ-tract) expansion in ataxin-2 protein (ATXN2). The RNA-binding protein ATXN2 interacts with the poly(A)-binding protein PABPC1, localizing to ribosomes at the rough endoplasmic reticulum or to polysomes.     Under cell stress ATXN2 and PABPC1 show redistribution to stress granules where mRNAs are kept away from translation and from degradation.     It is unknown whether ATXN2 associates preferentially with specific mRNAs or how it modulates their processing.     Here, we investigated Atxn2 knock-out (Atxn2-/-) mouse liver, cerebellum and midbrain regarding their RNA profile, employing oligonucleotide microarrays for screening and RNA deep sequencing for validation.     Modest ~1.4-fold upregulations were observed for the level of many mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and other translation pathway factors.     Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR and immunoblots in liver tissue confirmed these effects and demonstrated an inverse correlation also with PABPC1 mRNA and protein.     ATXN2 deficiency also enhanced phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6, while impairing the global protein synthesis rate, suggesting a block between the enhanced translation drive and the impaired execution.     Furthermore, ATXN2 overexpression and deficiency retarded cell cycle progression.     ATXN2 mRNA levels showed a delayed phasic twofold increase under amino acid and serum starvation, similar to ATXN3, but different from motor neuron disease genes MAPT and SQSTM1. ATXN2 mRNA levels depended particularly on mTOR signalling.     Altogether the data implicate ATXN2 in the adaptation of mRNA translation and cell growth to nutrient availability and stress.     Factorial design comparing ataxin-2 knock-out mice with wild type littermates in three different tissues (midbrain, cerebellum, liver) and 3 different ages.
 E-GEOD-42548 - TH-MYCN Mice with Caspase-8 Deficiency Develop Advanced Neuroblastoma with Bone Marrow Metastasis Neuroblastoma, the most common extracranial pediatric solid tumor, is responsible for 15% of all childhood cancer deaths.      Patients frequently present at diagnosis with metastatic disease, particularly to the bone marrow.      Advances in therapy and understanding of the metastatic process have been limited due in part, to the lack of animal models harboring bone marrow disease.      The widely employed transgenic model, the TH-MYCN mouse, exhibits limited metastasis to this site.      Here we establish the first genetic immunocompetent mouse model for metastatic neuroblastoma with enhanced secondary tumors in the bone marrow.      This model recapitulates two frequent alterations in metastatic neuroblasoma, over-expression of MYCN and loss of caspase-8 expression.      In this model, the mouse caspase-8 gene was deleted in neural crest lineage cells by crossing a TH-Cre transgenic mouse with a caspase-8 conditional knockout mouse.     This mouse was then crossed with the neuroblastoma prone TH-MYCN mouse.      While over-expression of MYCN by itself rarely caused bone marrow metastasis (5% average incidence), combining MYCN overexpression and caspase-8 deletion significantly increased bone marrow metastasis (37% average incidence).  Loss of caspase-8 expression did not alter the site, incidence, or latency of the primary tumors.      However, secondary tumors were detected in the bone marrow of these mice as early as week 9-10. The mouse model described in this work is a valuable tool to enhance our understanding of metastatic neuroblastoma and treatment options and underscores the role of caspase-8 in neuroblastoma progression.     Survey of spontateous 24 NB tumors and 5 bone marrow samples in wt and transgenic mice.
 E-GEOD-47900 - Differential gene expression analysis in motor and sensory cortex as a result of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a neuroinflammatory model for Multiple sclerosis. We performed micrarrays to investigate neuronal gene expression changes during acute inflammatory CNS axon injury using the murine myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35-55 (MOG35-55)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model.     The present study was assigned to assess the direct and indirect endogenous neuronal response to spinal axonal injury in the motor and sensory cortex.     Gene expression in motor and sensory cortex enriched tissue was assessed from four healthy and six EAE female mice.     Tissue was collected from mice with paraplegia or monoplegia, with contralateral hindlimb paresis (EAE day 18-21).  The gene expression profiles of the EAE mice were compared to the motor or sensory cortex of healthy control mice, resulting in a list of differentially expressed genes in healthy and EAE mice.
 E-MTAB-2445 - Transcriptional responses in liver upon acute CCl4 intoxication Since xenobiotics enter the organism via the liver, hepatocytes must cope with numerous perturbations.     In particular, exposure to hepatotoxic agents resulting in liver injury triggers a strong alteration in gene expression.     The contribution of these transcriptional regulatory networks to the propagation of injury (i.e. by modulation of metabolic pathways, inflammation, proliferation) are not fully understood.     Therefore, we conducted a time-resolved gene array study on mouse liver after exposure to a single intraperitoneal injection of the hepatotoxic compound carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). This model induces a transient injury which reaches its maximum between 2 to 3 days after injection, followed by a precise regenerative response.     The experiment included early time points (i.e. 2 and 8h) and late time points (1 to 16 days) to cover the initial events induced by CCl4 metabolization and cell stress, and the regenerative phase between 2-6 days after intoxicaiton.     C57BL/6N male mice (8-12 weeks old) were obtained from Charles Rivers (Sulzfeld, Germany). The local Ethics committee approved the experiments.     4-5 mice were used for each time point.     Mice received a single intraperitoneal injection of CCl4 (1.6 g/kg body weight) dissolved in 0.5 ml olive oil.     The liver tissue was collected after 2h, 8h, and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 16 days following CCl4 administration.     As control, mice received 0.5 ml of olive oil intraperitonealy for 1 or 8 days.     Healthy liver was collected from untreated mice.     At the indicated time points, mice were anesthetized and blood was collected from the heart with a 25 gauge needle, using EDTA as anticoagulant, for analysis of the liver transaminases GOT and GPT in serum.      Afterwards, the liver was resected, washed in ice cold PBS and sectioned for further analysis.     Liver tissue sections of about 0.5 cm2 were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80ﾰC for subsequent isolation of proteins or RNA.  RNA was isolated from mouse liver tissue using the Phenol/Chloroform method (Trizolﾮ, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturerﾒs instructions.     RNA concentration and integrity were determined spectrophotometrically in a Nanodropﾮ2000 (ThermoScientific, Waltham MA, USA) and in a Bioanalyzerﾮ  (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany), respectively.
 E-GEOD-34892 - IRF-8 extinguishes neutrophil production and promotes dendritic cell lineage commitment in both myeloid and lymphoid progenitors (Affymetrix). While most blood lineages are assumed to mature through a single cellular and developmental route downstream of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), dendritic cells (DCs) can be derived from both myeloid and lymphoid progenitors in vivo.      To determine how distinct progenitors can generate similar downstream lineages, we examined the transcriptional changes that accompany loss of in vivo myeloid potential as common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) differentiate into common dendritic cell progenitors (CDPs), and as lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors (LMPPs) differentiate into all lymphoid progenitors (ALPs).  Microarray studies revealed that Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF-8) expression increased during each of these transitions.      Competitive reconstitutions using Irf8-/- bone marrow demonstrated cell-intrinsic defects in the formation of CDPs and all splenic dendritic cell subsets.      Irf8-/- CMPs and, unexpectedly, Irf8-/- ALPs produced more neutrophils in vivo than their wild type counterparts at the expense of DCs.  Retroviral expression of IRF-8 in multiple progenitors led to reduced neutrophil production and increased numbers of DCs, even in the granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP), which does not normally possess conventional DC potential.      These data suggest that IRF-8 represses a neutrophil module of development and promotes convergent DC development from multiple lymphoid and myeloid progenitors autonomously of cellular context.     CMP (Lineage-c-kithiSca-1-CD11c- CD34+ Flk2+CD16/32-CD115- ) or CDP (Lin-c-kitintSca-1-CD34+Flk2+CD16/32-CD115+) were double sorted from the bone marrow of wild type C57BL/6 mice.      RNA was extracted from 10,000-30,000 sorted cells using Trizol (Invitrogen) and linear acrylamide (Ambion), amplified using Affymetrix Two-Cycle Amplification and IVT kits (Affymetrix), and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 chips.
 E-GEOD-33179 - Detection of miRNAs in exosomes released by mouse immature and mature dendritic cells Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most potent antigen (Ag)-presenting cells.     Whereas immature DCs down-regulate T cell responses to induce/maintain immunological tolerance, mature DCs promote immunity.     To amplify their functions, DCs communicate with neighboring DCs through soluble mediators, cell-to-cell contact and vesicle exchange.     Transfer of nanovesicles ( 100nm) derived from the endocytic pathway (termed exosomes) represents a novel mechanism of DC-to-DC communication.     The facts that exosomes contain exosome-shuttle microRNAs (miRNAs), and DC functions can be regulated by exogenous miRNAs, suggest that DC-to-DC interactions could be mediated through exosome-shuttle miRNAs, an hypothesis that remains to be tested.     Importantly, the mechanism of transfer of exosome-shuttle miRNAs from the exosome lumen to the cytosol of target cells is unknown.     Here, we demonstrate that DCs release exosomes with different miRNAs depending on the maturation of the DCs. By visualizing spontaneous transfer of exosomes between DCs, we demonstrate that exosomes fused with the target DCs, the latter followed by release of the exosome content into the DC cytosol.     Importantly, exosome-shuttle miRNAs are functional, as they repress target mRNAs of acceptor DCs. Our findings unveil a mechanism of transfer of exosome-shuttle miRNAs between DCs and its role as a means of communication and post-transcriptional regulation between DCs. The study has analyzed the microRNA content of 4 samples of immature exosomes, 4 samples of matures exosomes, 2 samples of immature bone-marrow-derived DCs, and 2 samples of mature bone marrow-derived DCs.
 E-GEOD-8642 - Transcription profiling of mouse liver from Mdr2-knockout mice to investigate mechanisms of carcinogenesis Mouse models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) simulate specific subgroups of human HCC. We investigated hepatocarcinogenesis in Mdr2-KO mice, a model of inflammation-associated HCC, using gene expression profiling and immunohistochemical analyses.     Gene expression profiling demonstrated that although Mdr2-KO mice differ from other published murine HCC models, they share several important deregulated pathways and many coordinately differentially expressed genes with human HCC datasets.     Analysis of genome positions of differentially expressed genes in liver tumors revealed a prolonged region of down-regulated genes on murine chromosome 8 in three of the six analyzed tumor samples.     This region is syntenic to human chromosomal regions that are frequently deleted in human HCC and harbor multiple tumor suppressor genes.     Real-time RT-PCR analysis of 16 tumor samples confirmed down-regulation of several tumor suppressors in most tumors.     We demonstrate that in the aged Mdr2-KO mice, cyclin D1 nuclear level is increased in dysplastic hepatocytes that do not form nodules; however, it is decreased in dysplastic nodules and in liver tumors.     We found that this decrease is mostly at the protein, rather than the mRNA level.     These findings raise the question on the role of cyclin D1 at early stages of hepatocarcinogenesis in the Mdr2-KO HCC model.     Furthermore, we show that most liver tumors in Mdr2-KO mice were characterized by the absence of b-catenin activation.     In conclusion, the Mdr2-KO mouse may serve as a model for b-catenin-negative subgroup of human HCCs characterized by low nuclear cyclin D1 levels in tumor cells and by down-regulation of multiple tumor suppressor genes.     Experiment Overall Design: The liver RNA samples from six Mdr2-KO tumors, six non-tumorous liver tissues (four matched and two unmatched), as well as from three control heterozygous mice at 16 months of age were subjected to gene expression profiling using the genome scale Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array.
 E-GEOD-18396 - Transcription profiling by array of Dmrt1 knock out mice Dmrt1 (doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1) is a conserved transcriptional regulator of male differentiation required for testicular development in vertebrates.     In mice of the 129Sv strain, loss of Dmrt1 causes a high incidence of teratomas.      Mutant 129Sv germ cells undergo apparently normal differentiation up to embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5), but some cells fail to arrest mitosis and ectopically express pluripotency markers.     Expression analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation identified DMRT1 target genes whose misexpression may underly teratoma formation.     Comparison of E13.5 testes gene expression between Dmrt1(+/-) and Dmrt1(-,-) animals that show high incidence of teratoma formation.
 E-GEOD-20235 - RNA expression data from glomeruli lacking von Hippel-Lindau protein in podocytes We and others have previously shown that glomerular endothelial cells and podocytes express hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs).  HIFs bind to hypoxia response elements in target genes, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, which is continually produced by podocytes throughout life.      To further assess function of HIFs in podocyte biology, podocin-Cre mice were mated with floxed von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) mice to selectively delete VHL, a component of an E3 ligase complex responsible for degradation of HIFs in normoxia.     We reasoned that cells lacking VHL would overexpress stable HIFs and upregulate hypoxia-responsive genes.      Progeny from these crosses displayed two phenotypes, non-proteinuric with glomerular basement membrane (GBM) defects and proteinuric with GBM defects and end-stage renal failure at ~6 months of age.      Gene changes associated with the mild, non-proteinuric phenotype were studied using isolated glomeruli from wildtype and Pod-Cre fVHL mice.     At 4 weeks of age, urine was collected and urinary albumin was quantified by Albuwell elisa from Pod-Cre fVHL litters.     At 6 weeks of age, glomeruli from 3 wildtype littermate controls and 3 non-proteinuric Pod-Cre fVHL mice were collected using the magnetic bead method.      RNA was extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays.
 E-GEOD-22310 - Changes in gene expression in implantation and inter-implantation sites by absence of Cbs This SuperSeries is composed of the following subset Series: GSE22187: Changes in gene expression in implantation sites by absence of Cbs GSE22189: Changes in gene expression in inter-implantation sites by absence of Cbs Refer to individual Series
 E-GEOD-65521 - The genome-wide effects of ionising  on mutation induction in the mammalian germline Investigation of genome-wide germline copy number mutations in mice after parental exposure to 3 Gy of acute X-rays The level of copy number mutations in offspring of exposed paternal mice was substantially increased when compared to the control Overall 262 samples were used of which 93 were control samples and 169 treated samples.     The control samples came from offspring of parents (C57BL6/J (male)  and  CBA/Ca (female)) with sham -ir while the treated samples were from offspring of 3 Gy whole-body acute irradiated paternal and non-exposed maternal.     The treated samples classified into two groups: post-meiotic and pre-meiotic according to exposed status of the sperm that gave rise to the offspring.     The reference sample for each offspring was equal mixture of paternal and maternal DNA.
 E-GEOD-5962 - Mouse Normal Variation Cancer of the prostate is influenced both by genetic predisposition and environmental factors.     The identification of genes capable of modulating cancer development has the potential to unravel disease heterogeneity and aid diagnostic and prevention strategies through improved understanding of gene-environment interactions.     To this end, mouse models have been developed to isolate the influences of individual genetic lesions in the context of consistent genotypes and environmental exposures.     However, the extent of normal prostatic phenotypic variability dictated by a genetic background potentially capable of influencing the process of carcinogenesis has not been established.     In this study we used microarray analysis to quantitate transcript abundance levels in the prostates of five commonly studied inbred mouse strains.     We applied a multiclass response t-test to identify genes whose expression in each strain significantly differed from the other four strains.     Approximately 13% (932 genes) exhibited significant differential expression (range 1.3 to 190-fold) in one strain relative to other strains (FDR≤10%). The pattern of variability in transcript levels did not result from variations unique to a particular strain, but rather represented genetic variability across all five strains assessed.     Expression differences were confirmed by qRT-PCR, or immunohistochemistry for several genes previously shown to influence cancer progression such as Psca, Mmp7, and Clusterin.     Analyses of human prostate transcripts orthologous to variable murine prostate genes identified differences in gene expression in benign epithelium that correlated with the differentiation state of adjacent tumors.     For example, the expression of apolipoprotein D, a gene known to enhance resistance to cell stress in Drosophila, was expressed at significantly greater levels in benign epithelium associated with high-grade versus low-grade cancers.     These data support the concept that the cellular, tissue, and organismal context contribute to oncogenesis and suggest that a predisposition to a sequence of events leading to pathology may be determined prior to cancer initiation.     Prostates from twelve mice from each of five strains of Mus musculus: C57BL/6J, 129X1/SvJ, BALB/cAnCrl, FVB/NJ and DBA/2NCrl, were resected and individual lobes were dissected: DP: dorsal prostate; LP: lateral prostate; VP: ventral prostate; AP: anterior prostate.     Each experimental sample represents a pool of equal amounts of RNA for each prostatic lobe from 3 animals.     Four independent experimental samples were created per strain: 12 mice divided into 4 pools of 3 mice each for a total of 4 microarray experiments per strain.     Amplified RNA from each experimental sample was hybridized against a reference sample (created by combining equal amounts of RNA from all the samples from all strains) onto custom mouse prostate cDNA microarrays using alternate dye-labeling to account for dye-specific effects.
 E-GEOD-53321 - Expression data from polarized macrophages: effect of p53 p53 is critically important in preventing oncogenesis but its role in non-cancer biology remains unclear.      Macrophages exist as two subtypes (M1 and M2). Nutlin-3a (p53 activator) inhibits M2 gene expression and phenotype.     p53 acts by suppressing transcription of c-Myc and thence regulates expression of a subset of M2 markers.     This work has implications for our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate plasticity of macrophages in health and disease.     We used microarrays to study the global programme of gene expression in nutlin-3a and 10058F4 (C-myc inhibitor) treated polarised mouse macrophages 5 groups of cultured mouse macrophages: (i) M0 (untreated), (ii) M1, (iii) M2, (iv) M2+nutlin-3a, (v) M2+MYC inhibitor (10058F4). 3 biological replicates per treatment group.
 E-GEOD-71285 - Gene expression in E10.5 Maxillary Arch Mesenchyme from control and Lhx6-/-;Lhx8-/- mutant embryos We used laser capture microdissection to isolate maxillary arch mesenchyme from E10.5 embryos.      This tissue was collected from both control (3x) and Lhx6-/-;Lhx8-/- mutant (3x) samples.     Transcriptional profiling was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays.     The mutant mice are of mixed genetic background of C57BL/6J, 129 and CD-1 strains.      The head of E10.5 embryos was collected and embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature resin (Tissue-Tek) by flash freezing on dry ice.     The frozen sections were collected on polyethylene naphthalate membrane slides (Leica). Leica LMD6000 Laser Micro-Dissection System was used to cut out the normal expression domain of Lhx6 and Lhx8 in the maxillary arch mesenchyme.     The tissue was collected from the entire antero-posterior extent of the maxillary arches.     Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen). Subsequent steps of transcriptional profiling were performed by the New York University Genome Technology Center, beginning with the amplification of RNA by Ovation Nano Amplification system (NuGen). RNA samples from three wild-type and three Lhx6−/−;Lhx8−/− mutant embryos, all somite count- and sex-matched (females), were analyzed with Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays.     A list of Lhx-regulated genes were generated from the microarray result based on the following criteria: fold change in the average expression between wild types and Lhx6−/−;Lhx8−/− mutants is  1.5, the difference is statistically significant (P   0.05) and the average intensity of the probe signal is  100 for wild-type and/or mutant samples.     The resulting list of 212 genes was used for a gene ontology analysis with DAVID (27,28).
 E-GEOD-65094 - Gene expression analysis of midbrain dopamine progenitors in embryonic mouse To improve the standardization of cell therapies for Parkinson’s disease, methods for the selection and isolation of midbrain dopaminergic progenitors for transplantation are required.     To facilitate this we established an expression profile for genes selectively expressed on transplantable midbrain dopaminergic progenitors using microarray analysis.     Expression of GFP in the ventral mesencephalon of embryonic E12.5 Ngn2-GFP mice identifies a distinct sub-population of cells containing virtually all of the midbrain dopaminergic progenitors.     Gene expression profiles from 3 biological replicates of FACS isolated GFP-positive cells from mouse Ngn2-GFP ventral mesencephalon were generated using microarrays.     To reduce the likelihood of identifying transcripts from non-dopaminergic progenitors, 3 biological replicates of FACS isolated GFP-negative cells from mouse Lmx1a-GFP ventral mesencephalon (definitively non-dopaminergic) were used as a reference population.
 E-GEOD-30953 - Twist1 Directly Regulates Genes That Promote Cell Proliferation and Migration in Developing Heart Valves Twist1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, is expressed in mesenchymal precursor populations during embryogenesis and in metastatic cancer cells.      In the developing heart, Twist1 is highly expressed in endocardial cushion (ECC) valve mesenchymal cells and is down regulated during valve differentiation and remodeling.      Previous studies demonstrated that Twist1 promotes cell proliferation, migration, and expression of primitive ECM molecules in ECC mesenchymal cells.     Furthermore, Twist1 expression is induced in human pediatric and adult diseased heart valves.      However, the Twist1 downstream target genes that mediate increased cell proliferation and migration during early heart valve development remain largely unknown.      Candidate gene and global gene profiling approaches were used to identify direct transcriptional targets of Twist1 during heart valve development.      Candidate target genes were analyzed for evolutionarily conserved regions (ECRs) containing E-box consensus sequences that are potential Twist1 binding sequences.       ECRs containing conserved E-box sequences were identified for Twist1 responsive genes Tbx20, Cdh11, Sema3C, Rab39b, and Gadd45a.  Twist1 binding to these sequences in vivo was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, and binding was detected in ECCs but not late stage remodeling valves.      In addition identified Twist1 target genes are highly expressed in ECCs and have reduced expression during heart valve remodeling in vivo which is consistent with the expression pattern of Twist1. Together these analyses identify multiple new genes involved in cell proliferation and migration that are differentially expressed in the developing heart valves, are responsive to Twist1 transcriptional function, and contain Twist1 responsive regulatory sequences.     Murine MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cells were treated with siScrambled control or siTwist1 to achieve knockdown of Twist1. Both siScr and siTwist1 were performed in triplicate.      Isolated RNA was analyzed with Affymetrix muring MOE 430 2.0 gene chip microarray.
 E-GEOD-7012 - Transcription profiling of mouse C2C12 myoblast cell line to identify oscillatory genes in somitogenesis During somitogenesis, oscillatory expression of genes in the notch and wnt signaling pathways plays a key role in regulating segmentation.     These oscillations in expression levels are elements of a species-specific developmental mechanism.     To date, the periodicity and components of the human clock remain unstudied.     Here we show that a human mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) model can be induced to display oscillatory gene expression.     We observed that the known cycling gene HES1 oscillated with a 5 hour period, consistent with available data on the rate of somitogenesis in humans.     We also observed cycling of Hes1 expression in mouse C2C12 myoblasts with a period of 2 hours, consistent with previous in vitro and embryonic studies.     Furthermore, we used microarray and quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) analysis to identify additional genes that display oscillatory expression both in vitro and in mouse embryos.     We confirmed oscillatory expression of the notch pathway gene Maml3 and the wnt pathway gene Nkd2 by whole mount in situ hybridization analysis and Q-PCR. Expression patterns of these genes were disrupted in Wnt3atm1Amc mutants but not in Dll3pu mutants.     Our results demonstrate that human and mouse in vitro models can recapitulate oscillatory expression observed in embryo and that a number of genes in multiple developmental pathways display dynamic expression in vitro.     Experiment Overall Design: Synchronization of C2C12 myoblasts was carried out as follows: T-25 cm flasks were set up in parallel.     These cells were grown to 90% confluence in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS then incubated in DMEM with only 0.2% FBS for 24 hours, and returned to DMEM supplemented with FBS. Samples were collected every 30 min.     for 8 hours.
 E-GEOD-41127 - Gene expression profile in the spleen of mice fed Lactobacillus brevis KB290 Lactic acid bacteria confer a variety of health benefits.     Here we investigate the mechanisms by which Lactobacillus brevis KB290 enhances cell-mediated cytotoxic activity.     We fed a diet containing KB290 (3 × 10^9 colony-forming units/g) , or potato starch, to 9-week-old female BALB/c mice for 1, 4, 7, or 14 days and examined the cytotoxic activity of splenocytes was measured.     RNA was extracted from the spleen and analyzed for gene expression by DNA microarray.     KB290 enhanced the cell-mediated cytotoxic activity of splenocytes.     The Gene Ontology (GO) terms related to immune process were significantly enriched in up-regulated gene set for 7 days and the GO terms related to cellular process were enriched in down-regulated gene set on days 4 and 7. Among the GO terms related to immune process, positive regulation of T cell-mediated cytotoxicity was existed.     Almost all of the genes included in the term encoded MHC class I molecules, which are involved in the presentation of antigen to CD8+ cytotoxic T cells.     On the other hand, the over-represented Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways among the up-regulated genes were those for natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity and antigen processing and presentation on day 1. Although the up-regulated genes involved in antigen processing and presentation for stimulation of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells were not observed on day 14, some genes involved in T cell and natural killer cell activation remained up-regulated until day 14. The sequential gene expression profiling reflected the changes in cytotoxic activity during KB290 feeding.     These results suggest that the enhanced cytotoxic activity could have been caused both by activation of natural killer cells and by CD8+ cytotoxic T cells stimulated via MHC class I presentation.     Specific-pathogen-free female BALB/c mice, aged 8 weeks, were purchased from Charles River Laboratories Japan, Inc. They (n = 48) were divided into two groups, control and KB290 (4 cages per group) with equal mean body weights.     They were allowed to free access to a commercial normal diet CE-2 (CLEA Japan, Inc.) and sterile water during one-week acclimation period.     Then, they received lyophilized KB290 for the treatment group diet (3x109 cfu/g) or 5.8% (w/w) potato starch (Nippon Starch Chemical) for the control group diet for 1, 4, 7, and 14 days.     Daily intake of KB290 containing diet per treated mouse was 3.99g, or about 1 × 1010 cfu.     On day 1, 4, 7, and 14, six mice in each group were euthanized and their spleens were sampled for Cell-mediated cytotoxicity and DNA microarray assay.
 E-GEOD-10627 - Transcription profiling of mouse hematopoietic cells (GMP, CMP, CLP and HSC), FACS sorted from wild type and Mll-AF9 knock-ins The pathways by which oncogenes, such as MLL-AF9, initiate transformation and leukemia in  humans and mice are incompletely defined.     In a study of target cells and oncogene dosage, we found that  Mll-AF9, when under endogenous regulatory control, efficiently transformed LSK (Lin- Sca1+ c-kit+) stem  cells while committed granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) were transformation-resistant and did not  cause leukemia.     Mll-AF9 was expressed at higher levels in hematopoietic stem (HSC) than GMP cells.     Mll-  AF9 gene dosage effects were directly shown in experiments where GMPs were efficiently transformed by  the high dosage of Mll-AF9 resulting from retroviral transduction.     Mll-AF9 up-regulated expression of 196  genes in both LSK and progenitor cells, but to higher levels in LSKs than in committed myeloid progenitors.     Experiment Overall Design: Comparison of gene expression profiles among four types of hematopoietic cells (GMP, CMP, CLP and HSC), FACS sorted from wild type and Mll-AF9 knock-in mice.     The goal was to identify genes differentially expressed in each Mll-AF9 cell type compared to the corresponding wild type cells.
 E-GEOD-21515 - Expression data from mouse ES and iPS cells Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells were produced from reprogramming of somatic cells, and they are shown to possess pluripotent properties similar to embryonic stem (ES) cells.     Here we used microarrays to detail the global expression pattern among the ES cells and iPS cells, as well as the original mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF), to identify important players involved in the reprogramming process.     Mouse ES cell cultures, as well as selected iPS cell lines and the original MEF cells they were derived from, were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.     Three biological replicates for each sample were processed.     GeneChips were processed and data were analyzed using the RMA package of Bioconductor.

 E-MEXP-2152 - Transcription profiling of mouse wild type or Batf deficient T cells cultured under various combinations of IL-6 orTGF-beta Wild type and Batf deficient T cells were stimulated under various combinations of IL-6 or TGF-beta.
 E-MTAB-2895 - NONO mutations cause syndromic intellectual disability and inhibitory synaptic defects Identifying causes of sporadic intellectual disability remains a considerable medical challenge.      Here, we demonstrate that null mutations in the NONO gene, a member of the Drosophila Behavior Human Splicing (DBHS) protein family, are a novel cause of  X-linked syndromic intellectual disability.     Comparing humans to Nono-deficient mice revealed related behavioral and craniofacial anomalies, as well as global transcriptional dysregulation.     Nono-deficient mice also showed deregulation of a large number of synaptic transcripts, causing a disorganization of inhibitory synapses, with impaired postsynaptic scaffolding of gephyrin.     Alteration of gephyrin clustering could be rescued by over-expression of Gabra2 in NONO-compromised neurons.     These findings link NONO to intellectual disability and first highlight the key role of  DBHS proteins in  functional organization of GABAergic synapses.
 E-GEOD-14211 - Expression profiling of Noto-GFP+ notochord progenitor cells sorted from E8.5 mouse embryos Using a combination of cell sorting and microarray analysis, we identified almost 200 genes as having a high level of expression in the notochord.     After whole mount in situ hybridization screening, we confirmed approximately one third of these as having a novel notochord expression pattern.      Keywords: cell type comparison - embryonic Noto-GFP+ notochord progenitors versus surrounding GFP- comparator cells 3 biological replicates - each replicate includes an experiment cell population (Noto-GFP positive cell sort) and a comparator population (GFP negative cell sort)
 E-GEOD-59464 - Polycomb PRC2 antagonizes de novo DNA methylation at the maternal Gtl2-Rian-Mirg locus [Affymetrix Expression] Wild-type mouse embryonic stem cells are compared with mutants for components of PRC2 including  Ezh2-/-, Eed-/-, and Jarid2-/- cells.     Gene expression microarrays were used to compare the expression for these.     This experiment compares wild-type gene expression with mutants for different PRC2 components, including Ezh2-/-, Eee-/- and Jarid2-/- with two replicates for each using Affymetrix Gene Expression Arrays.
 E-GEOD-12499 - Transcription profiling of mouse adult neural stem cells exogenously expressing Oct4 produces one-factor induced pluripotent stem (1F iPS) Pluripotency can be induced in murine and human fibroblast by transduction of four transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc). Previously we reported that two factors (Oct4 and Klf4) are sufficient for reprogramming adult mouse neural stem cells (NSCs) to a pluripotent state.     However, although NSCs endogenously express the factors Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4, our previous report does not elucidate why exogenous expression of either Klf4 or c-Myc is still required for reprogramming.     Here we report that exogenous expression of Oct4 is sufficient to generate one-factor induced pluripotent stem (1F iPS) cells without any oncogenic factors, such as c-Myc and Klf4, from mouse adult NSCs, which endogenously express Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4, and also intermediate reprogramming markers alkaline phosphatase (AP), stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 (SSEA-1).  These results extend our previous report proposing that somatic cells can be reprogrammed to a pluripotent state with a reducing number of reprogramming factors when the complementing factors are endogenously expressed in the somatic cells.     Experiment Overall Design: 10 hybridizations in total.

 E-GEOD-34973 - Gene expression data from the mesenchymal stem cell line OP9M2 that supported expansion of human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in vitro One of the long-standing goals in the field has been to establish a culture system that would allow maintenance of HSC properties ex vivo.     In the absence of such system, the ability to model human hematopoiesis in vitro has been limited, and there has been little progress in the expansion of human HSCs for clinical application.     To that end, we defined a mesenchymal stem cell co-culture system based on a monoclonal OP9 stromal cell line (OP9M2), for expansion of clonally multipotent human HSPCs that were protected from apoptosis and immediate differentiation, and retained the HSPC phenotype.     To identify the supportive mechanisms, we performed a genome-wide gene expression analysis of OP9M2 stromal cells and compared the expression to a non-supportive stomal line (BFC012). This co-culture system provides a new, well-defined platform for studying mechanisms involved in HSC-niche interactions and protection of critical HSC properties ex vivo.     To determine the cellular identity and the supportive mechanism of the OP9M2 cells, we compared the OP9M2 cells with non-supportive BFC012 stromal cells using Affymetrix mouse microarrays.
 E-GEOD-11859 - Transcription profiling of mouse with Hedgehog-induced medulloblastoma reveals oncogenic Hedgehog signaling promotes medulloblastoma from lineage-restricted granule cell progenitors Origins of the brain tumor, medulloblastoma, from stem cells or restricted pro-genitor cells are unclear.     To investigate this, we activated oncogenic Hedgehog signaling in multipotent and lineage-restricted CNS progenitors.     We observed that normal unipo-tent cerebellar granule neuron precursors (CGNP) derive from hGFAP+ and Olig2+ rhombic lip progenitors.     Hedgehog activation in a spectrum of early and late stage CNS progenitors generated similar medulloblastomas, but not other brain cancers, indicating that acquisition of CGNP identity is essential for tumorigenesis.     We show in human and mouse medulloblastoma that cells expressing the glia-associated markers Gfap and Olig2 are neoplastic and that they retain features of embryonic-type granule lineage progenitors.     Thus, oncogenic Hedgehog signaling promotes medulloblastoma from lineage-restricted granule cell progenitors.     Gene expression profiling of cerebellar tumors generated from various early and late stage CNS progenitor cells.     Experiment Overall Design: Group comparisons with biological replicates
 E-GEOD-33942 - Role of PKD2 in TCR-induced transcriptional reprogramming of naïve T cells Comparison of transcriptional profile of TCR stimulated P14-TCR wild-type and P14-PKD2 null murine lymph node cells Lymph node cells from 3 biological replicates (3 wild-type and 3 PKD2 null mice) were isolated and left unstimulated or stimulated for 4 hours with antigenic peptide (gp33-41) prior to RNA extraction and hybridization to Affymetrix microarray.
 E-GEOD-12998 - Comparative transcriptomic analysis of BA- or BL- associated murine colonic epithelium after O157 infection A huge number of microorganisms are colonized in human gut and the balance of their composition is closely related to human health.     Recently, many probiotics such as bifidobacteria or lactobacilli have been introduced in our life as effective agents.     However, we have not well understood their beneficial mechanisms including host-bacterial crosstalk.     Accordingly, we took advantage of the protective mechanisms of probiotics against lethal infection of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 in murine gnotobiote model system  Germ free (GF) mice was used as control.     E means O157-monoassociated mice.     BAE means B. adolescentis and O157-associated mice.     BLE means B. longum and O157-associated mice.     Numbers indicate the days after O157 infection.
 E-GEOD-24061 - MAQC-II Project: Hamner data set The Hamner data set (endpoint A) was provided by The Hamner Institutes for Health Sciences (Research Triangle Park, NC, USA). The study objective was to apply microarray gene expression data from the lung of female B6C3F1 mice exposed to a 13-week treatment of chemicals to predict increased lung tumor incidence in the 2-year rodent cancer bioassays of the National Toxicology Program.     If successful, the results may form the basis of a more efficient and economical approach for evaluating the carcinogenic activity of chemicals.     Microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays on three to four mice per treatment group, and a total of 70 mice were analyzed and used as the MAQC-II's training set (GEO Series GSE6116). Additional data from another set of 88 mice were collected later and provided as the MAQC-II's external validation set (this Series). The training dataset had already been deposited in GEO by its provider and its accession number is GSE6116. 88 Samples
 E-GEOD-29813 - Global gene expression profiling of hepatocellular carcinomas in B6C3F1 mice induced by Ginkgo biloba extract by gavage for two years Ginkgo biloba leaf extract (GBE) has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine and today is used as an herbal supplement for various indications such as improving neural function, anti-oxidant and anti-cancer effects.     As part of the herbal supplement industry, these compounds are largely unregulated, and may be consumed in large concentrations over extended periods of time.     This is of particular concern, because the long-term effects in terms of toxicity and carcinogenicity data is lacking for many herbal products, including GBE. The 2-year B6C3F1 mouse carcinogenicity bioassay indicated a marked dose-related increase in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development associated with exposure to GBE. We have shown that the mechanism of this increase in tumorigenesis is related to a marked increase in the incidence of β-catenin mutation, and report a novel mechanism of constitutive β-catenin activation through post-translational modification leading to constitutive Wnt signaling and unregulated growth signaling and oncogenesis.     Furthermore, using global gene expression profiling, we show that GBE-induced HCC exhibit overrepresentation of gene categories associated with human cancer and HCC signaling including upregulation of relevant oncogenes and suppression of critical tumor suppressor genes, as well as chronic oxidative stress, a known inducer of calpain-mediated degradation and promoter of hepatocarcinogenesis in humans.     These data provide a molecular mechanism to GBE-induced HCC in B6C3F1 mice that is relevant to human cancer, and provides relevant molecular data that will provide the groundwork for further risk assessment of unregulated compounds, including herbal supplements.     Six hepatocellular carcinomas induced by GBE, six spontaneous hepatocellular carcinomas, and six normal liver samples, three technical replicates each.
 E-GEOD-26551 - Roles of STAT3 and STAT5 in regulation of gene expression under Th17 differentiation Interleukin 2 (IL-2), a cytokine linked to human autoimmune diseases, limits IL-17 production.     We show that deletion of Stat3 in T cells abrogates IL-17 production and attenuates autoimmunity associated with IL-2 deficiency.     While STAT3 induces IL-17 and RORγt and inhibits Foxp3, IL-2 inhibited IL-17 independently of Foxp3 and RORγt. We found that STAT3 and STAT5 bound to multiple common sites across the Il17 genetic locus.     The induction of STAT5 binding by IL-2 was associated with a reduction in STAT3 binding at these sites and the inhibition of associated active epigenetic marks.     Titrating the relative activation of STAT3 and STAT5 modulated TH17 cell specification.     Thus, the balance rather than the absolute magnitude of these signals determines the propensity of cells to make a key inflammatory cytokine.     The roles of STAT3 and STAT5 in regulation of gene expression under Th17 differentiation was investigated.      Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays were used to evaluate global gene expression.
 E-GEOD-42135 - Expression data from preimplantation mouse embryos Landmark events occur in a coordinated manner during preimplantation development of the mammalian embryo, yet the regulatory network that orchestrates these events remains largely unknown.     We delineated the regulons of Oct4, Sall4, and Nanog using morpholino (MO)-mediated gene knockdowns followed by microarray analysis of pooled embryos.     1-cell fertilized mouse embryos were injected with a morpholino and were collected at either 20 hours or at 44 hours after microinjection.
 E-GEOD-8924 - Transcription profiling of mouse testicular response to recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (rFSH) in hypogonadal males In the normal mouse the pituitary gonadotrophins determine development, maturation and physiological regulation of the testis with follicle-stimulating  hormone (FSH) activating the Sertoli cell and luteinising hormone (LH) the Leydig cell.     To look at the potential interaction of cell types within the testis following hormone stimulation we have investigated the effect of rFSH on testicular gene expression in the hypogonadal (hpg) male mouse.     Due to a deletion in the gene encoding gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH), FSH and LH levels are at the lower limit of detection in the circulation and mice remain in a pre-pubertal state throughout life unless given exogenous hormone.     Here we have addressed important question of changes in the global gene expression profile of testicular tissue following hormone stimulation (rFSH) for 12, 24 and 72h following injections compared to control untreated hpg males of the same age.     Experiment Overall Design: Adult 10 week old hpg males were injected sc with 8 I.U. of rFSH (Gonal F, Serono Pharmaceuticals) in 0.2ml of PBS (Sigma,UK) every 12 h for 12, 24 and 72 h. Mice were killed one hour after the last injection by cervical dislocation, testes dissected out, weighed and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.     Tissue was stored at -70oC until use.     RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and quantified on a NanoDrop ND-1000 (NanoDrop Wilmington, DE). RNA quality was checked using the Agilent bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Testicular gene expression was examined in four individual mice at 12 and 72 h and 3 mice at 24h using high-density oligonucleotide mouse MOE430A arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), comparison was made with a group of 7 untreated hpg males of the same age.
 E-GEOD-71367 - Quercetin suppresses immune cell accumulation and improves mitochondrial gene expression in epididymal adipose tissue of diet-induced obese mice We examined the effect of quercetin on the gene expression and function of epididymal adipose tissue (EAT) in Western diet-induced obese mice.     Quercetin suppressed the increase in the number of macrophages and the decrease in the ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ T cells in EAT, and the elevation of plasma leptin and TNFα levels in mice fed the Western diet.     Comprehensive gene expression analysis revealed that quercetin suppressed gene expression associated with the accumulation and activation of immune cells, including macrophages and lymphocytes in EAT. It also improved the expression of the oxidative stress-sensitive transcription factor NFκB, NADPH oxidases, and antioxidant enzymes.     Quercetin markedly increased gene expression associated with mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial DNA Quercetin most likely universally suppresses the accumulation and activation of immune cells, including anti-inflammatory cells, whereas it specifically increased gene expression associated with mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.     Suppression of oxidative stress and NFκB activity likely contributed to the prevention of the accumulation and activation of immune cells and resulting chronic inflammation.     Quercetin most likely universally suppresses the accumulation and activation of immune cells, including anti-inflammatory cells, whereas it specifically increased gene expression associated with mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.     Suppression of oxidative stress and NFκB activity likely contributed to the prevention of the accumulation and activation of immune cells and resulting chronic inflammation.     C57BL/6J mice were fed a control diet; a Western diet high in fat, cholesterol, and sucrose; or the same Western diet containing 0.05% quercetin for 18 weeks.
 E-GEOD-36810 - Expression data from mouse lungs exposed in-utero and/or as an adult to second-hand smoke (SHS) Second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure during pregnancy has adverse effects on offspring.     We used microarrays to characterize the gene expression changes caused by in-utero exposure and adult exposure to SHS in adult mouse lungs.     Left lungs from Balb/c male mice were collected at 15 weeks of age for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix mouse 430 2.0 microarrays.     Based on their smoke exposure status, there are 4 groups of mice, each exposed in-utero to filtered-air or SHS and as an adult to filtered-air or SHS. We extracted RNA from 4 animals from each group for microarray analysis (N = 16 samples).
 E-GEOD-17934 - Analysis of gene expression in the mouse embryo pharyngeal arch This study was conducted to examine normal gene expression in the pharyngeal arch during mouse embryonic development Wild type embryonic tissue containing the pharyngeal arches was collected from five independent samples (n=5) at stage E10.5 by dissection.     Total RNA was isolated for analysis by Affymetrix mouse genome 430A GeneChip.
 E-GEOD-5425 - Transcription profiling of mouse spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion to test the fundamental quantitative differences between central and peripheral nervous system transcriptomes We used microarrays to test the fundamental quantitative differences between central and peripheral nervous system transcriptomes.     Experiment Overall Design: 3 independent SC and 3 independent DRG  samples were analyzed.     Each sample contained material from 4 age-matched male C57B/6 mice.
 E-GEOD-13718 - Alterations in Cell Growth and Signaling in  ErbB3 Binding Protein -1 (Ebp1) Deficient Mice Background: The ErbB3 binding protein-1 (Ebp1) belongs to a family of DNA/RNA binding proteins implicated in cell growth, apoptosis and differentiation.     However, the physiological role of Ebp1 in the whole organism is not known.     Therefore, we generated Ebp1-deficient mice carrying a gene trap insertion in intron 2 of  the Ebp1 (pa2g4) gene.     Results: Ebp1 -/- mice were on average 30% smaller than wild type and heterozygous sex matched littermates.     Growth retardation was apparent from Day 10 until Day 30. IGF-1 production and IGBP-3 and 4 protein levels were reduced in  both embryo fibroblasts and adult knock-out mice.     The proliferation of fibroblasts derived from Day 12.5  knock out embryos was also decreased as compared to that of wild type cells.     Microarray expression analysis revealed changes in genes important in cell growth including members of the MAPK signal transduction pathway.     In addition, the expression or activation of proliferation related genes such as AKT and the androgen receptor, previously demonstrated to be affected by Ebp1 expression in vitro,  were altered in adult tissues.     Conclusions: These results indicate that Ebp1 can affect growth in an animal model, but that the expression of proliferation related genes is cell and context specific.     The Ebp1-/- mouse line represents a new in vivo model to investigate Ebp1 function in the whole organism.     Isolation of   Mouse Embryo Fibroblasts (MEFS) and proliferation assays.     Embryos (12.5 days) were minced and incubated in 0.25% trypsin and 5 U of DNAse I for 37º C for 30 min.     Dulbecco’s MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin and streptomycin were added to the cell suspension and cells centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min.     The pellet was resuspended in medium and cells were grown in MEM and passaged by trypsinization.
 E-GEOD-3075 - Transcription profiling of spinal cords from nmd mice tranplanted with ALDHhiSSClo neural stem cells to study molecular mechanism of delayed SMARD1 disease progression induced by the transplantation. SMARD1 is an infantile autosomal recessive motor neuron (MN) disease, caused by mutations in the Immunoglobulin mu binding protein 2 (IGHMBP2). We investigated the potential of a spinal cord neural stem cell population isolated on the basis of aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (ALDH) to modify disease progression of nmd mice, an animal model of SMARD1. ALDHhiSSClo stem cells are self-renewing and multipotent and when intratechally transplanted in nmd mice generate motor neurons properly localized in the spinal cord ventral horns.     Transplanted nmd animals presented delayed disease progression, sparing of motor neurons and ventral root axons and increased life-span.      To further investigate the molecular events responsible for these differences, microarray and Real time RT-PCR analysis of wild-type, mutated and transplanted nmd spinal cord were undertaken.      We demonstrated a down-regulation of genes involved in excitatory amino acid toxicity and oxidative stress handling, as well as an up-regulation of genes related to the chromatin organization in nmd compared to wild-type mice, suggesting that they may play a role in SMARD1 pathogenesis.     Spinal cord of nmd transplanted mice expressed high transcript levels for genes related to neurogenesis such as Doublecortin (DCX), LIS1 and drebrin.     The presence of DCX-expressing cells in adult nmd spinal cord suggests that both exogenous and endogenous neurogenesis may contribute to the observed nmd phenotype amelioration.      Experiment Overall Design: We intratechally transplanted a spinal cord neural stem cell population isolated on the basis of aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (ALDH) in nmd mice, an animal model of SMARD1. Experiment Overall Design: We analyzed the lumbar spinal cord tract of transplanted nmd mice (n=3), untransplanted nmd mice (n=3) and wild-type mice (n=3) (all mice are of male gender). The latter groups underwent surgical procedure with vehicle.     The surgical procedure and cell transplantation were done at P1 and the animals were sacrificed at 6 weeks of age.
 E-MEXP-1623 - Transcription profiling of skeletal muscle from wild type and mdx mice at three time points In this study, in order to minimize the genetic variability of muscle samples we have used two approaches.     First, we have analyzed the gene expression profile from a single skeletal muscle, the medial gastrocnemius (MG), and not from a pool of different muscles which could have different expression profiles.     Second, we have performed the temporal gene expression profiling by extracting the MG muscles of the same individual from the both legs at two different times to minimize the inter-individual genetic variability.     The MG muscle represent an excellent candidate for biopsy due to its easy accessible by surgery and also because its biopsy is well tolerated by the animals allowing us to perform another later biopsy in the other leg to obtain two MG samples of the same individual at two different times.     Moreover, MG muscle is composed of approximately 20-30% type I (red) fibers and 70-80% type II (white) fibers {Ariano MA, 1973}, {Simard C, 1988}, {Zhan WZ, 1992} and therefore is more representative of skeletal muscle tissue in general than a muscle composed exclusively by red or white fibers. br  br  br  br The transcript expression profiles in MG muscles from mdx and wild-type mice were analyzed at 3 weeks, 1.5 months and 3 months of life by using the 430 2.0 gene chips from Affymetrix (n=3 for each condition). The differentially expressed transcripts which showed differences ?1.5-fold were obtained by performing three different comparisons: 1) genes differentially expressed in mdx compared with controls at each point in time (additional file 1); 2) temporal analysis of the genes differentially expressed in mdx mice between the three points in time also compared with the variations in control mice (additional file 2); and 3) temporal analysis of the genes differentially expressed in control mice between the three points in time also compared with the variations in mdx mice (additional file 3). The first comparison that we performed, by comparing the gene expression between mdx and control mice at every point in time, was similar to that performed in previous longitudinal studies {Porter JD, 2003}, {Rouger K, 2002}, {Turk R, 2005}. However, the other two comparisons were directed to elucidate the genes that are varying throughout the period of time analyzed in every mice strain, and therefore we obtained on the one hand the genes that vary in mdx mice but not in wild-type, and on the other hand the genes that vary in control animals but remain unchanged in mdx mice between the times analyzed.     To present the results in a more comprehensive form,  all the genes were classified in seven different categories: Cell adhesion & extracellular matrix; Proteolysis; Muscle structure & regeneration; Inflammation & immune response; Cell signaling & cell communication; Metabolism; and Others/unknown.     The resulting genes from our study were classified in their functional categories using information from Affymetrix (www.affymetrix.com) and from the Gene Ontology database accessible in the Jackson Laboratory Mouse Genome Informatics website (www.informatics.jax.org). br  br 
 E-GEOD-9428 - Transcription profiling of nouse pigmented epithial cells Adult (6- to 8-week-old) C57BL/6 purchased from CLEA Japan Inc. (Tokyo, Japan) were used as donors ocular pigment epithelium (PE). To cultivate retinal PE (RPE) eyes were cut into two parts along a circumferential line posterior to the ciliary process, creating a ciliary body-deficient posterior eyecup.      The eyecup was then incubated in 0.2% trypsin (Biowhitaker) for 1 hr.  These tissues were triturated to make a single cell suspension, and then re-suspended in the medium.     Experiment Overall Design: Comparison of gene expression pattern in Mouse Primary Cultured Cell Lines (RPE, RPE+IFNg).
 E-GEOD-20570 - Transcription profiling by array of mouse cardiac tissue mutant for PTIP Methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me) at actively expressed, cell type-specific genes is established during development by the Trithorax group of epigenetic regulators.      In mammals, the Trithorax family includes KMT2A-D (MLL1-4), a family of SET domain proteins that function in large complexes to impart mono-, di-, and trimethylation at H3K4.  Individual KMT2s and their co-factors are essential for embryonic development and the establishment of correct gene expression patterns, presumably by demarcating the active and accessible regions of the genome in a cell specific and heritable manner.      Despite the importance of H3K4me marks in development, little is known about the importance of histone methylation in maintaining gene expression patterns in fully differentiated and non-dividing cell types.     In this report, we utilized an inducible cardiac-specific Cre driver to delete the PTIP protein, a key component of a H3K4me complex, and ask whether this activity is still required to maintain the phenotype of terminally differentiated cardiomyocytes.      Our results demonstrate that reducing the H3K4me3 marks is sufficient to alter gene expression patterns and significantly augment systolic heart function.      These results clearly show that maintenance of H3K4me3 marks is necessary for the stability of the transcriptional program in differentiated cells.     The array we performed allowed us to identify genes that are regulated by PTIP and histone methylation.     8-week-old littermate mice on a mixed C57B6 and B6129 background were utilized.     Three mice were on a background with a PTIP floxed allele and a wild type PTIP allele (PTIP+1, PTIP+2, PTIP+3). Three mice had a transgene that expresses a modified estrogen receptor -Cre recombinase fusion protein under the control of a cardiac-specific driver (alpha myosin heavy chain, Jackson Lab stock #005650) and a floxed PTIP allele and a null PTIP (PTIPKO1, PTIPKO2, PTIPKO3). Both groups of mice were injected with tamoxifen at 8 weeks of age.     Tamoxifen deletes the floxed PTIP allele in the PTIPKO mice.     5 days after tamoxifen injection, RNA was harvested from left ventricle (LV) apices in both groups.     RNA was then sent to the University of Michigan microarray facility core for analysis.
 E-GEOD-28523 - Transcriptomes of subthalamic nuclei from mice submitted to a short-term cocaine-dependent conditioned place preference Molecular basis of transition to addiction in vulnerable individuals is largely unknown.     We hypothesized that human susceptibility genes can be identified on the basis of conserved molecular mechanisms in rodent brains.     We used a short-term cocaine-dependent conditioned place preference (CPP) to identify genetic hallmarks of early steps of reward memory in basal ganglia including accumbens nucleus (NAc), globus pallidus (GP) and subthalamic nucleus (STN). Using genome-wide microarray analysis and CPP as a quantitative trait, we found that synaptic plasticity-related genes are deregulated in these three structures.     A significant enrichment in bona fide transcripts involved in dendritic spine local translation was evidenced.     mGluR5 is transcriptionally deregulated in Acc and GP of cocaine-treated animals.     Grin3a that encodes a NMDA receptor subunit involved in Ca++ permeability is deregulated in NAc. Furthermore, Orexin/Hcrt transcript level is decreased in STN, a region known to be involved in discriminating addictive drugs and natural rewards.     We also found that mGluR5 and Grin3a expression deregulation is sufficient to induce changes in synaptic plasticity-related genes.     Altogether, these results suggest that a combined deregulation of mGluR5 and Grin3A pathway in NAc, mGluR5 in GP and orexin system in STN may generate an incentive memory contrasted between addictive drugs and natural rewards.     Such pathways may include clusters of genes that are potential susceptibility genes for transition to addiction.     Agilent Whole Mouse Genome oligomicroarrays (GEO accession no. GPL2872, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) were used.     They contain 60-mer DNA probes synthesized in situ in a 44k format.     Of 44,290 spots, 2756 are controls.     The remaining 41,534 spots represent 33,661 unique transcripts which correspond to 20,202 unique human genes.     Five  independent (five subthalamic nuclei from mice treated with cocaine compared to five subthalamic nuclei from mice treated with saline solution) hybridizations were carried out for each group of biological conditions using exchanged dye-labeled RNA targets (i.e., Cy3 and Cy5 dyeswapping experiments). Each hybridization was numerized hybridization by a GenePix 4000B Microarray Scanner and an Agilent G6525 Microarray Scanner
 E-GEOD-38754 - Temporal changes of gene expression in mouse heart, kidney and lung during juvenile growth Temporal changes of gene expression from 1-wk- to 4-wk and 8-wk-old mouse in heart, kidney and lung.     Mammalian somatic growth is rapid in early postnatal life but then slows and eventually ceases in multiple tissues.     We hypothesized that there exists a postnatal gene expression program that is common to multiple tissues and is responsible for this coordinate growth deceleration.     Consistent with this hypothesis, microarray analysis identified  1600 genes that were regulated with age coordinately in kidney, lung, and heart of juvenile mice, including many genes that regulate proliferation.     As examples, we focused on three growth-promoting genes, Igf2, Mest, and Peg3, that were markedly downregulated with age.     We conclude that there exists an extensive genetic program occurring during postnatal life.     Many of the involved genes are regulated coordinately in multiple organs, including many genes that regulate cell proliferation.     At least some of these are themselves apparently regulated by growth, suggesting that, in the embryo, a gene expression pattern is established that allows for rapid somatic growth of multiple tissues but then, during postnatal life, this growth leads to negative-feedback changes in gene expression that in turn slow and eventually halt somatic growth, thus imposing a fundamental limit on adult body size.     To compare gene expression between fast-growing animals and more slowly growing animals, we extracted total mRNA from kidney and lung in 1-wk, 4-wk, and 8-wk-old mice (5 animals each).
 E-GEOD-24705 - mRNA expression data from iPSCs, ntESCs and iPSC-nt-ESCs We generated three kinds of genetically identical mouse reprogrammed cells: induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), nuclear transfer embryonic stem cells (ntESCs) and iPSC-nt-ESCs that are established after successively reprogramming of iPSCs by nuclear transfer (NT). NtESCs show better developmental potential than iPSCs, whereas iPSC-nt-ESCs display worse developmental potential than iPSCs. We used microarrays to distinguish the gene expression differences among three pluriptoent stem cells and identified that imprinted genes had a similar expression pattern in iPSCs and iPSC-nt-ESCs. We sought to obtain genetic identical pluripotent stem cell lines in order to minimize genetic variations among different reprogrammed cells.     To that end, we established a genetically homogenous secondary reprogramming system, in which mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) carrying doxycycline (dox)-inducible lentiviruses expressing Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc were isolated and used as donors for different reprogramming experiments.     We generated iPSCs after plating MEFs in the presence of dox in ES culture conditions, and then derived ntESCs after transplantation of the nucleus from the same MEFs into enucleated oocyte.     Furthermore, we successively reprogrammed iPSCs by means of NT and established a set of nt-iPSC lines.      Pluripotent stem cells generated from different reprogramming strategies were for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
 E-GEOD-12707 - Transcription profiling of mouse thymocytes from animals hypomorphic for Atg16l1 The aim of this study is to survey global gene expression of total thymocytes from wild-type mice and Atg16l1 mutant (hypomorph) mice.     Experiment Overall Design: Total RNA was extracted from total thymocytes from the following samples and analyzed: Experiment Overall Design: Atg16l1 hypomorph: 2 mice (7 weeks), 1 male and 1 female Experiment Overall Design: Control: 2 mice (7 weeks), 1 male and 1 female Experiment Overall Design: Global gene expression profiling was performed using Affymetrix technology.      The animals used were independent of each other.
 E-GEOD-20636 - Gene expression in OVE26 diabetic kidney during the development of nephropathy OVE26 mouse was chosen to study the progressive changes in renal gene expression because it displays the most advanced albuminuria mouse models that assembles advanced human diabetic nephropathy.     OVE26 mice induce inflammatory gene expression changes consistent with advanced renal disease, associated with severe albuminuria and not reported in any other diabetic models.     They provide the first opportunity in a model of diabetic nephropathy to assess the effect of induction of inflammatory proteins that have been implicated in renal injury.     Microarray expression was performed on whole kidney from control and diabetic mice at 2, 4 and 8 months of age and validated by rtPCR, in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry.
 E-GEOD-28437 - Expression data from mouse small intestinal γδ intraepithelial lymphocytes The mammalian gastrointestinal tract harbors thousands of bacterial species that include symbionts as well as potential pathogens.     The immune responses that limit access of these bacteria to underlying tissue remain poorly defined.     In this study, we used microarrays to uncover the transcriptional responses that occur in small intestinal γδ intraepithelial lymphocytes following bacterial challenge.     γδ intraepithelial lymphocytes (γδ IEL) were isolated by flow cytometry from the small intestines of germ-free mice, or from age- and sex-matched conventionally-raised counterparts.     We extracted RNAs from these purified γδ IEL for analysis on Affymetrix DNA microarrays.     The mice were all  8 weeks in age, and each sample represents a pool of RNAs from 5-8 mice.
 E-GEOD-6514 - Transcription profiling of mouse brain during spontaneous sleep and prolonged wakefulness These studies address temporal changes in gene expression during spontaneous sleep and extended wakefulness in the mouse cerebral cortex, a neuronal target for processes that control sleep; and the hypothalamus, an important site of sleep regulatory processes.     We determined these changes by comparing expression in sleeping animals sacrificed at different times during the lights on period, to that in animals sleep deprived and sacrificed at the same diurnal time.     Experiment Overall Design: Experiments were performed on male mice (C57/BL6), 10 weeks of age ±1 week.     Animals were housed in a light/dark cycle of 12 hrs, in a pathogen free, temperature- and humidity-controlled room (22°C and 45-55%, respectively) with water available ad libitum.     Food was accessible for 12 hrs only during the active period.     Animals were subjected to 14 days of acclimatization during which a nighttime feeding pattern was established.     This was done to avoid differential food intake between mice that were subsequently sleep deprived during the lights on period and those allowed to sleep.      Mice were sacrificed following 3, 6, 9 and 12 hrs of total sleep deprivation (n=5 at each time point). Deprivation was initiated at lights-on, and performed through gentle handling.     Sleeping animals, which were left undisturbed, were sacrificed at the same diurnal time points as sleep deprived mice (n=5 at each time point). An additional control group of mice were sacrificed at time zero, i.e., at the time of lights-on (n=5). All mice were behaviorally monitored using the AccuScan infrared monitoring system that detects movement when the mouse crosses electronic beams (Columbus Instruments).  Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation.     Brain sectioning was performed according to the mouse brain atlas of Franklin and Paxinos . The primary and secondary motor areas (M1 and M2) of the cerebral cortex and broadly defined regions and zones of the hypothalamus were sampled.     RNA was isolated with Trizol (Invitrogen) and further purified using RNeasy columns (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's instructions.
 E-GEOD-7607 - Transcription profiling of mouse Atm-/-,mTerc-/-,p53-/- triple knock-out lymphoma vs normal Highly rearranged and mutated cancer genomes present major challenges in the identification of pathogenetic events driving the cancer process.      Here, we engineered lymphoma-prone mice with chromosomal instability to assess the utility of mouse models in cancer gene discovery and the extent of cross-species overlap in cancer-associated copy number aberrations.      Integrating with targeted re-sequencing, our comparative oncogenomic studies efficiently identified FBXW7 and PTEN as commonly deleted or mutated tumor suppressors in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL).  More generally, the murine cancers acquire widespread recurrent clonal amplifications and deletions targeting loci syntenic to alterations present in not only human T-ALL but also diverse tumors of hematopoietic, mesenchymal and epithelial types.     These results thus support the view that murine and human tumors experience common biological processes driven by orthologous genetic events as they evolve towards a malignant phenotype.      The highly concordant nature of genomic events encourages the use of genome unstable murine cancer models in the discovery of biologically relevant driver events in human cancer.     Experiment Overall Design: 18 lymphoma samples from Atm-/-, mTerc-/-, p53-/- triple knock-out mice were analyzed.     3 week old hymus RNA from healthy mice of p53 Hets was used as reference.     Each sample was hybridized with dye-swap replica.
 E-GEOD-10953 - Transcription profiling of mouse laser capture microdissected SOD1 G93A motor neurons reveals cellular pathways involved in the adaptation and progression of motor neuron injury in the mouse model of familial ALS Microarray analysis has been applied to the study of ALS in order to investigate gene expression in whole spinal cord homogenates of SOD1 G93A mice and human ALS cases, although the massive presence of glial cells and inflammatory factors has made it difficult to define which gene expression changes were motor neuron specific.     Recently, laser capture microdissection (LCM), combined with microarray analysis, has allowed the identification of motor neuron specific changes in gene expression in human ALS cases.     The aim of the present study is to combine LCM and microarray analysis to study how motor neurons in the spinal cord of transgenic SOD1 G93A mice and transgenic SOD1 WT respond to stimuli determined by the presence of the human mutant protein throughout the evolution of the stages in motor neuron injury Experiment Overall Design: Motor neurons have been isolated from the spinal cord of G93A mice and non transgenic littermates at different time points and the transcription expression profile of the isolated motor neurons has been analysed
 E-GEOD-10784 - Transcription profiling of mouse Df(16)A/+ and wild type littermates This represents an unbiased evaluation of the transcriptional response in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus areas in the Df(16)A/+ mice, a mouse model of human 22q11 microdeletion syndrome.     These mice were generated by chromosomal engineering and carry a microdeltion of ~1.3Mb in the mouse locus syntenic to the human 22q11.1; The reasoning behind this expression profiling is that alterations in transcriptional programs reflect either downstream (immediate or remote) effects of the deficiency or reactive (compensatory) changes, and can thus point to affected biological processes and molecular functions.     Experiment Overall Design: A total of 20 PFC and 20 HPC from 10 Df(16)A/+ mutants and 10 WT control mice was used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.     All mice were male littermates 8 weeks of age.
 E-GEOD-2934 - Transcription profiling of mouse male and female blastocysts Male embryos are reported to develop faster than female in the preimplantation stage.      Therefore, male and female embryos can be considered phenotypically different as early as the preimplantation stage.      Employing our sexing system of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) tagging X chromosomes, we compared the global gene expression pattern of male and female embryos at the blastocyst stage using DNA microarray.     Experiment Overall Design: samples were collected from three independent preparations and the experiments were triplicated.      Scanned microarray results were processed with Feature Extraction software (ver.     7.5, Agilent). 　The hybridization experiments were duplicated in a reciprocal labeling manner to reduce dye integration bias, and total of six hybridizations were carried out for the entire analysis.　     Combining plural array results and statistical analyses were carried out by Luminator software (Rosetta).
 E-GEOD-39557 - Expression data from genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) 3 Cell lines from Apc, p53 (AP) GEMMs were compared to 12 cell lines from Apc, Kras, p53 (AKP) GEMMs. Mouse 430 2.0 arrays were used to determine genomic expression differences between the two genotypes (AP and AKP). RNA was extracted from 3 AP and 10 AKP cell lines using the Qiagen RNEasy kit, and hybridized to individual Affymetrix mouse 430 2.0 chips as per manufacturer's instructions
 E-GEOD-18061 - Transcription profiling by array of hematopoietic stem cells from mice heterozygous for CREB binding protein Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is considered a disease of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) origin.      To begin to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the deregulation of HSCs in MDS, we performed comparative gene expression profiling on Crebbp+/- and wild type HSCs.  We chose to isolate HSCs from the fetal liver (FLHSC) because at this stage there were no differences in cell number between Crebbp+/- and wild type fetal livers, suggesting no overt hematopoietic differences.      Thus, any change in gene expression found in Crebbp+/- FLHSCs is likely to reflect the initially compromised genetic program of HSC regulation, as opposed to that of Crebbp+/- HSCs in adult bone marrow, where secondary changes in gene expression may also occur as compensatory mechanisms for a compromised or failing hematopoietic system.     We used day 14.5 post coitus FLHSC (Sca-1+,Lin-,AA4.1+,c-Kit++) from wild type (wt) and Crebbp heterozygous (ht) embryos to examine changes in gene expression before overt myelodysplastic disease manifestation.     Total RNA from wt and Crebbp+/- FLHSCs was isolated, PCR-amplified using the Ovation RNA amplification system and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 expression microarrays.
 E-GEOD-17049 - Transcription profiling by array of spleens from mice infected with different Trypanosoma brucei strains Different strains of T. brucei induce different degrees of pathology in infected animals, and TREU927-infected mice display greater splenomegaly and anaemia than 247-infected mice.     The analysis of differential host gene expression in infected spleens has allowed the identification of which pathways or processes are crucial in determining the progression of disease, for example IL10, LXR/RXR activation and alternative macrophage activation.     We used microarray analysis to examine host gene expression between uninfected and infected mice, and between mice infected with the two trypanosome strains.     Mouse spleens were dissected from infected or uninfected mice 10 days post infection, when the differences in pathology criteria (hepatomegaly, red blood cell numbers, reticulocyte percentage, IL10, IFNg and Il12 levels, and splenomegaly) were the greatest.     This allowed a three-way comparison, uninfected vs 247-infected, uninfected vs 927-infected, and 247-infected vs 927-infected, allowing us to analyse genes that are differentially expressed between infected and uninfected spleens, but also crucially allows the differentiation between host gene expression with pathogenic (927) and less pathogenic (247) trypanosome strains.
 E-GEOD-26986 - The consequences of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) depletion on hepatic lipid metabolism in mice In the present study, we investigated the consequences of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) depletion on hepatic lipid metabolism in mice fed during three months with a diet presenting a high n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio to induce n-3 PUFA depletion.     Microarray analyses were performed to identify the molecular targets involved in the development of hepatic steatosis associated with n-3 PUFA depletion.     Male C57Bl/6J mice (9 weeks old) were housed in groups of four mice per cage at 22°C in a 12h light/dark cycle and given free access to diet and water.      After an acclimatization period of 1 week, the mice were fed a control (CT) or an n-3 PUFA-depleted diet (DEF) for 3 months.     At the end of the study period, mice (CT, n=6; DEF, n=7) were anesthetized after a 6h period of fasting.     Some mice (CT: n=4 et DEF: n=7) were anesthetized without being starved.     A fraction of the main liver lobe was fixed-frozen in isopentane and kept at -80°C for histological analysis.     The excess tissue material was immediately clamped in liquid N2 and kept at -80°C. All mice experiments were approved by the local animal ethics committee, and the housing conditions were as specified by the Belgian Law of November 14, 1993 on the protection of laboratory animals (agreement n° LA 1230314).
 E-GEOD-22693 - Regulation of gene expression program by Fsp27 in white and brown adipose tissue Background: Brown and white adipose tissues (BAT and WAT) play critical roles in controlling energy homeostasis and in the development of obesity and diabetes.     Fsp27 is expressed in both BAT and WAT and promotes lipid storage and the development of obesity and diabetes.     In addition, Fsp27-deficient white adipocytes acquired certain BAT-like properties including reduced lipid droplet size and increased mitochondrial activity.     Using microarray and semi-quantitative real-time PCR analyses, we systematically analyzed the gene expression profile in Fsp27-deficient WAT and BAT. Results: We observed that BAT-selective genes were significantly up-regulated, whereas WAT-selective genes were down-regulated in the WAT of Fsp27-/- mice.     Expression levels of BAT-selective genes were also dramatically up-regulated in the WAT of leptin and Fsp27 double deficient mice.     Furthermore, we observed that expression levels of genes in multiple metabolic pathways including oxidative phosphorylation, the TCA cycle and fatty acid synthesis and oxidation were increased in the Fsp27-/- WAT. In contrast, expression levels for extracellular matrix remodeling, the classic complement pathway and TGF-β signaling&quot;were down-regulated in the WAT of Fsp27-/- mice.     Most importantly, regulatory factors that determine BAT identity such as CEBPα/β, PRDM16 and major components in the cAMP pathway were markedly up-regulated in the WAT of Fsp27-/- mice.     Interestingly, we observed distinct gene expression profiles in the BAT of Fsp27-/- mice.     Conclusion: Our data suggest that Fsp27 acts at upstream to control gene expression of diverse pathways, in particular the expression of regulatory factors that determine the identity of BAT and WAT. Therefore, Fsp27 is an important molecular determinant for the identity of WAT, and loss of Fsp27 leads to the conversion of WAT to a BAT-like tissue.     Total RNAs were extracted from individual gonadal WAT of five pairs of 3-month-old wild-type and Fsp27-null male mice.     Equal amounts of RNA from five pairs of mice with each genotype were pooled to form RNA pools (total 45 μg). Duplicate experiments were carried out.
 E-GEOD-16438 - Array profiling of dystrophin-deficient mice with a secondary glycosylation defect A deletion in the CMAH gene in humans occurred approximately 3.5 million years ago.     This resulted in the inactivation of the CMP-Neu5Ac hydroxylase enzyme, and hence, in the specific deficiency in N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), a form of sialic acid, in all modern humans.     Although there is evidence that this molecular milestone in the origin of humans may have led to the evolution of human-specific pathogens, how deficiency in Neu5Gc might alter progression of non-infectious human diseases remains unanswered.      Here, we have investigated cardiac and skeletal muscle gene expression changes in mdx mice, a model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), that do or do not carry the human-like inactivating mutation in the mouse Cmah gene.      We have evidence that Neu5Gc-deficiency in humans might explain some of the discrepancies in the disease phenotype between mdx mice and DMD patients.     The study had four groups of mice: 1) Wild type, 2) Cmah KO (mice carrying a human-like mutation in the Cmah gene and hence have human-like deficiency in Neu5Gc sialic acid), 3) mdx (mouse model for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy), and 4) mdx mice deficient in Cmah.     Gene expression was studied in heart and gastrocnemius muscle samples.     Three replicates per group/tissue.
 E-GEOD-16364 - Gene expression profile in mouse embryonic stem cells in which endogenous Pcl2 expression was stably knocked down using short hairpin RNA Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are highly conserved epigenetic transcriptional repressors important for the control of numerous developmental gene expression programs and have recently been implicated in the modulation of embryonic stem cell (ESC) identity.     We identified the PcG protein PCL2 (polycomb-like 2) in a genome-wide screen for novel regulators of self-renewal and pluripotency and predicted that it would play an important role in mouse ESC fate determination.     Using multiple biochemical strategies, we provide evidence that PCL2 is a novel Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-associated protein in mouse ESCs. Knockdown of Pcl2 in ESCs resulted in heightened self-renewal characteristics, defects in differentiation and altered patterns of histone methylation.     Through integration of global gene expression and promoter occupancy analyses of both PCL2 and PRC2 components EZH2 and SUZ12, we have predicted PCL2 target genes and formulated regulatory networks describing the role of PCL2 both in modulating transcription of ESC self-renewal genes in undifferentiated ESCs as well as developmental regulators during early commitment and differentiation.     Cells were stably expressing Pcl2 shRNA or shRNA mismatch control sequences.     Hybridizations of three biological replicates for both the control and Pcl2 shRNA clone were performed.
 E-GEOD-27605 - The intestinal stem cell signature identifies colorectal cancer stem cells and predicts disease relapse Using EphB2 or the ISC marker Lgr5, we have FACS-purified and profiled intestinal stem cells (ISCs), crypt proliferative progenitors and late transient amplifying cells to define a gene expression program specific for normal ISCs. A frequent complication in colorectal cancer (CRC) is regeneration of the tumor after therapy.     The intestinal stem cell signature predicts disease relapse in CRC and identifies a stem cell-like population that displays robust tumor- initiating capacity in immunodeficient mice as well as long-term self-renewal potential.     We FACS purified mouse intestinal crypt cells according to their EphB2 or Lgr5 contents.     We used Affymetrix chips to hybridize 2 samples from EphB2 high, 2 samples from EphB2 medium and 2 samples from EphB2 low cells (one sample from each group in a first hybridization on February 2009 plus an additional sample from each group on March 2009). Additionally, we hybridized one sample from Lgr5-EGFP high and one sample from Lgr5-EGFP low cells, obtained from Lgr5-EGFP knock-in mice (Barker et al., 2007).
 E-GEOD-24207 - mRNA analysis in different mouse tissues The functioning of a specific tissue depends on the expression pattern of the different genes.     We used microarrays to compare gene expression across different murine tissues, to get a better understanding in the expression pattern and functioning of the different tissues.     With this analysis, we were not only able to identify genes that were specifically expressed in a spicific tissue but, as important, we also identified genes that were specifically repressed in a tissue, compared to al the other analysed tissues.      C57Bl6/j6 (Janvier) mice between 10 and 12 weeks old were used to isolate 22 different tissues.     Mainly male mice were used, except for placenta and ovary, where female mice were used.     Also the mouse insulinoma cellline MIN6 was analysed in this study.     For every tissue, at least 3 biological replicates were used.
 E-GEOD-17542 - VTA neurons show an adaptive transcriptional response to MPTP which differs from SN neurons Implications for neuroprotection in Parkinson's disease  Parkinson’s disease and its characteristic symptoms are thought to arise from the progressive degeneration of specific midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons.      In humans, DA neurons of the substantia nigra (SN) and their projections to the striatum show selective vulnerability, while neighboring DA neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are relatively spared from degeneration.      This pattern of cell loss is mimicked in humans, primates, and certain rodents by the neurotoxin MPTP.  In this study, we aimed to test the hypothesis that there are factors in the VTA that are potentially neuroprotective against MPTP and that these factors change over time.      We have found a differential transcriptional response within the cells of the SN and VTA to sustained exposure to a low dose of MPTP.  Specifically, the VTA has increased expression of 148 genes as an early response to MPTP and 113 genes as a late response to MPTP toxicity.      This response encompasses many areas of cellular function, including protein regulation (Phf6) and ion/metal regulation (PANK2, Car4).  Notably, these responses were largely absent from the cells of the SN.  Our data show a clear dynamic response in maintaining the homeostasis and viability of the neurons in the VTA that is lacking in the SN after neurotoxin challenge.      We used microarrays to analyze the differential response of the substantia nigra (SN) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) to a chronic low dose of the neurotoxin MPTP. Transgenic hTH-GFP mice were treated with MPTP (4mg/kg) for either 2 or 10 days.      Control mice were given an equal volume of saline for 10 days.      Dopamine neurons from the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental areas of control and MPTP treated animals were laser captured.      The RNA was isolated and processed for microarray hybridization.      Each group had three biological replicates, for a total of 18 samples.      Three each in the following: Control SN, Control VTA, 2 day MPTP SN, 2 day MPTP VTA, 10 day MPTP SN, 10 day MPTP VTA.  Samples were log2 transformed and RMA normalized using Agilent Genespring 10.0 GX.
 E-GEOD-35160 - Gene expression profile of transgenic mice expressing a constitutively active Nrf2 mutant (caNrf2) in keratinocytes The Nrf2 transcription factor is a key player in the cellular stress response, which regulates the expression of important antioxidant enzymes and other cytoprotective proteins.     We recently generated a novel transgenic mouse model to determine the function of Nrf2 in the skin.     These mice revealed interesting phenotypic abnormalities, including hyperkeratosis and acanthosis.     To gain insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms, we wanted to identify genes, which are differentially expressed in the skin of wild-type and mutant mice before the onset of phenotypic abnormalities.     RNA from whole skin of 3 single P2.5  K5cre-caNrf2 (tg/tg) and 3 single P2.5 K5cre-wt (tg/wt=control) mice were used
 E-GEOD-4928 - Transcription profiling of XX and XY sorted mouse somatic support cells and XX and XY mouse whole gonads to identify potential new mammalian gonadal sex determining genes. Gonadal sex determining (GSD) genes that initiate fetal ovarian and testicular development and differentiation are expressed in the cells of the urogenital ridge that differentiate as somatic support cells (SSCs), i.e., granulosa cells of the ovary and Sertoli cells of the testis.     To identify potential new mammalian GSD genes, we analyzed the gene expression differences between XX and XY SSCs cells isolated from the gonads of embryonic day (E) 13 mouse fetuses carrying an EGFP reporter transgene expressed specifically in SSCs. In addition, genome wide expression differences between XX and XY E13 whole gonads were examined.     Newly identified differentially expressed transcripts are potential GSD genes involved in unexplained human sex reversal cases.     Experiment Overall Design: Two seperate RNA samples were obtained from E13 XX and XY sorted EGFP+ cells, and two seperate RNA samples were obtained from E13 XX and XY pooled gonads.     Approximately 20ng of total RNA from each sample was used to generate biotin-labelled cDNA. Approximately 2.5ug biotin labelled cDNA of each sample was used for each Mouse Genome 430v2.0 GeneChip array (Affymetrix). Significantly differentially expressed transcripts were identified using R/maanova.     Statistical significance was determined at a false discovery rate value of equal to or less than 1%.
 E-GEOD-23119 - Effect of vitamin A deficiency (VAD) on mouse spermatogonial transcriptome profiles The objective of this study was to understand the genetic mechanisms of Vitamin-A-Deficiency (VAD)-induced arrest of spermatogonial stem-cell differentiation.     Vitamin A and its derivatives (the retinoids) participate in many physiological processes including vision, cellular differentiation and reproduction.     VAD affects spermatogenesis, the subject of our present study.     Spermatogenesis is a highly regulated process of differentiation and complex morphologic alterations that, in the postnatal testis, leads to the formation of sperm in the seminiferous epithelium.     VAD causes early cessation of spermatogenesis, characterized by degeneration of meiotic germ cells, leading to seminiferous tubules containing mostly type A spermatogonia and Sertoli cells.     In this study, we investigated the molecular basis of VAD on spermatogenesis in mice.     We used adult Balb/C mice fed with a Control or VAD diet for an extended period of time (8-28 weeks) and selected two time points (18 and 25 weeks) for microarray analysis.      To understand the effect of VAD on the spermatogonial stem cell transcriptome, we studied isolated pure populations of spermatogonia from control and vitamin-A-deficient mice from two representative time points (18 and 25 weeks) using Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays.     We identified target genes involved in the arrest of spermatogonial differentiation and spermatogenesis.     Our results establish a better understanding of the chronology and magnitude of the consequences of VAD on mouse testes and add to the current knowledge of the molecular regulatory mechanisms of germ cell development.     Spermatogonia were isolated by the STATPUT procedure with minor modifications.     VAD mice were sacrificed at 18 and 25 weeks of VAD treatment for spermatogonia isolation.     Decapsulated testes from 2 mice were suspended in RPMI medium containing collagenase (0.6 mg/ml), Hyaluronidase (0.12 mg/ml) and DNAse I (1.25 mg/ml) and incubated at 37ºC for 30 minutes in a shaking water bath.     The tissues were then allowed to come down the tube and the supernatant (containing interstitial cells) was removed.     The pellet was incubated with 3 ml of 0.25% Trypsin /EDTA (GIBCO, Invitrogen, USA), in the presence of DNAse I (0.2 mg/ml) at 37ºC for 15 minutes in a shaking water bath.     The dispersed cells were washed twice with RPMI medium containing 10% heat inactivated FBS to neutralize the protease activity, and filtered through a sterile 0.22 nylon to remove any undigested fragments.     Cells of the dissociated seminiferous epithelium were then plated overnight in a 34ºC 3% CO2 incubator.     The following day, germ cells, in suspension, were separated by sedimentation with use of a 2-4% BSA gradient.     The cells were allowed to sediment for a standard period of 2.5 h, and fractions of 2-ml volume were collected.     The cells of each fraction were examined under a phase contrast microscope, and fractions containing cells of similar size and morphology were pooled and spun down by low-speed centrifugation.     Purity of spermatogonia was estimated and was routinely higher than 90%. Total RNA was extracted from the isolated germ cells using TRIzol ® Reagent, and cleaned with RNeasy minicolumns.     RNA content was determined by measurement of optical density at 260 nm. Only the RNA samples showing an OD 260/280 ratio higher than 1.8 were used for microarray hybridization.     Raw expression values in Affymetrix CEL file format were generated by GeneChip Operating Software.
 E-GEOD-28421 - Expression and alternative splicing data from 1-month-old Rbfox1 KO brain Rbfox1 regulates the alternative splicing of many transcripts in neurons.     We have characterized the Rbfox1-dependent changes in expression and alternative splicing by comparing Rbfox1-KO brain to WT brain.     In this dataset, we include the splicing and expression data obtained from dissected WT and Rbfox1 KO mouse brains.     6 total samples were analyzed: brains from 3 WT male mice and 3 Rbfox1 KO male mice, all 1 month of age.
 E-GEOD-40222 - A combinatorial extracellular matrix platform identifies cell-extracellular matrix interactions that correlate with metastasis Extracellular matrix interactions play essential roles in normal physiology and many pathological processes.     Here, we report a novel screening platform capable of measuring phenotypic responses to combinations of ECM molecules.     While the importance of ECM interactions in metastasis is well documented, systematic approaches to identify their roles in distinct stages of tumorigenesis have not been described.     Using a genetic mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma, we measured the ECM-dependent adhesion of tumor-derived cells.      Hierarchical clustering of adhesion profiles generated using this platform differentially segregated metastatic cell lines from primary tumor lines.     Furthermore, we uncovered that metastatic cells selectively associate with fibronectin when in combination with galectin-3, galectin-8, or laminin.     These interactions appear to be mediated in part by α3β1 integrin both in vitro and in vivo.     We show that these galectins also correlate with human disease at both a transcriptional and histological level.     Thus, our in vitro platform allowed us to interrogate the interactions of metastatic cells with their surrounding environment, and identified ECM and integrin interactions that could lead to therapeutic targets for metastasis prevention.

 E-GEOD-46875 - Association of maternal mRNA with the spindle in mouse oocytes The oocytes of many species, both invertebrate and vertebrate, contain a large collection of localized determinants in the form of proteins and translationally inactive maternal mRNAs. However, it is unknown whether mouse oocytes contain localized MmRNA determinants and what mechanisms might be responsible for their control.     We collected intact MII oocytes, enucleated MII oocyte cytoplasts (with the spindle removed), and spindle-chromosome complexes which had been microsurgically removed.     RNA was extracted, amplified, labeled, and applied to microarrays to determine if any MmRNA determinants were localized to the SCC. We used microarrays to determine whether maternal mRNAs in mouse oocytes are enriched in the meiotic spindle
 E-MEXP-3157 - Transcription profile of dendritic cell line D1 treated with  Lactobacillus Paracasei Mouse D1 dendritic cells treated with Lactobacillus Paracasei at different time points: 0h, 2h, 4h, 8h, 12h, 24h
 E-GEOD-51432 - β-Cryptoxanthin suppresses inflammatory gene expression in diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in mice To evaluate the effect of β-cryptoxanthin on diet-induced NASH, we fed a high-cholesterol and high-fat diet (CL diet) with or without 0.003% β-cryptoxanthin to C56BL/6J mice for 12 weeks.     After feeding, β-cryptoxanthin attenuated fat accumulation, increases in Kupffer and activated stellate cells, and fibrosis in CL diet-induced NASH in the mice.     Comprehensive gene expression analysis showed that although β-cryptoxanthin histochemically reduced steatosis, it was more effective in inhibiting inflammatory gene expression change in NASH. β-Cryptoxanthin reduced the alteration of expression of genes associated with cell death, inflammatory responses, infiltration and activation of macrophages and other leukocytes, quantity of T cells, and free radical scavenging.     However, it showed little effect on the expression of genes related to cholesterol and other lipid metabolism.     The expression of markers of M1 and M2 macrophages, T helper cells, and cytotoxic T cells was significantly induced in NASH and reduced by β-cryptoxanthin.     β-Cryptoxanthin suppressed the expression of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-inducible and/or TNFα-inducible genes and the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase 1 in NASH. Thus, β-cryptoxanthin suppresses inflammation and the resulting fibrosis probably by primarily suppressing the increase and activation of macrophages and other immune cells.     Reducing oxidative stress is likely to be a major mechanism of inflammation and injury suppression in the livers of mice with NASH. Eight-week old male C57BL/6J mice were fed for 12 weeks on a CRF-1 standard chow (control), a high-cholesterol and high-fat diet (CL diet; 38.23% CRF-1, 60% cocoa butter, 1.25% cholesterol, 0.5% sodium cholate) or a CL diet containing 0.003% β-cryptoxanthin.
 E-MEXP-213 - Transcription profiling of mouse MLL-CBP line to assess the immediate effects of induced MLL-CBP expression on hematopoiesis Chromosomal translocations that fuse the Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) gene with multiple partners typify acute leukemias of infancy as well as therapy-related leukemias.     We utilized a conditional knock-in strategy to bypass the embryonic lethality caused by MLL-CBP expression and to assess the immediate effects of induced MLL-CBP expression on hematopoiesis.      Within days of activating MLL-CBP, the fusion protein selectively expanded granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMP) and enhanced their self-renewal/proliferation.      MLL-CBP altered the gene expression program of GMP, upregulating a subset of genes including Hox a9.  Inhibition of Hox a9 expression by RNA interference (RNAi) demonstrated that MLL-CBP required Hox a9 for its enhanced cell expansion.      Following exposure to sublethal g-irradiation or N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU), MLL-CBP mice developed myelomonocytic hyperplasia and progressed to fatal myeloproliferative disorders.      These represented the spectrum of therapy-induced acute myelomonocytic leukemia (t-AMML)/chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (t-CMML)/myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disorder (t-MD/MPD) similar to that seen in humans possessing the t(11;16).  This model of MLL-CBP therapy-related myeloproliferative disease demonstrates the selectivity of this MLL-fusion for GMP cells and its ability to initiate leukemogenesis in conjunction with cooperating mutations.
 E-GEOD-9567 - Transcription profiling of mouse whole skin from pRB deficient animals reveals that p107 acts as a tumor suppressor The specific deletion of Rb gene in epidermis leads to altered proliferation and differentiation, but not to the development of spontaneous tumors.     Our previous data have demonstrated the existence of a functional compensation of Rb loss by Rbl1 (p107) in as the phenotypic differences with respect to controls are intensified.     However, the possible evolution of this aggravated phenotype, in particular in relationship with tumorigenesis, has not been evaluated due to the premature death of the double deficient mice.     We have now investigated whether p107 can also act as a tumor suppressor in pRb-deficient epidermis using different experimental approaches.     We found spontaneous tumor development in doubly-deficient skin grafts.     Moreover, Rb-deficient keratinocytes are susceptible to Ha-ras-induced transformation, and this susceptibility is enhanced by p107 loss.     Further functional analyses, including microarray gene expression profiling, indicated that the loss of p107, in the absence of pRb, produces the reduction of p53-dependent pro-apoptotic signals.     Overall, our data demonstrate that p107 behaves as a tumor suppressor in epidermis in the absence of pRb and suggest novel tumor-suppressive roles for p107 in the context of functional p53 and activated Ras Experiment Overall Design: Pools from RNA whole skin extracts from 3 animals of same genotype were done and analyzed, per duplicate, in mouse microarrays.     Comparison was performed between the 4 different genotypes.
 E-GEOD-47730 - TLR4/NF-κB-responsive microRNAs in a mouse model of skeletal muscle ischemia-reperfusion injury TLR4/NF-κB signaling plays a central mediator in response to danger signals released in the muscle ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). This study was designed to profile TLR4/NF-κB-responsive microRNAs (miRNAs) in the skeletal muscles following IRI. Following 2 h of ischemia and subsequent reperfusion for indicated times (0 h, 4 h, 1 d, and 7 d) of the isolated thigh skeletal muscles based on femoral artery perfusion of C57BL/6, Tlr4–/–, and NF-κB–/–mice, the muscle specimens were analyzed with an miRNA array to detect the TLR4/NF-κB-responsive miRNAs. Male C57BL/6 mice (10–12 weeks of age, 22–35 g) were purchased from BioLasco (Taiwan). Tlr4–/– (C57BL/10ScNJ) and NF-κB–/– (B6.Cg-Nfkb1tm1Bal/J) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). All housing conditions were established and surgical procedures, analgesia, and assessments were performed in an AAALAC-accredited, SPF facility following national and institutional guidelines.     Animal protocols were approved by the IACUC of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital.     Mice were anesthetized with an anesthetic cocktail consisting of 0.1 mg/g ketamine and 0.01 mg/g xylazine, given as an intraperitoneal injection (0.01 ml/g body weight). After the induction of anesthesia, the mice were restrained in a supine position on a heating pad to maintain body temperature at 37°C. The quadriceps muscle perfused based on the femoral artery of the mouse was carefully isolated away from the femoral bone and the underlying adductor muscle group.     In the ischemic group, ischemia was induced by placing a microvascular clamp carefully across the proximal site of vascular pedicle for 2 h and then the microvascular clamp was removed.     Good vascular inflow and outflow through the pedicle was verified under direct magnified vision.     In the sham-operated control group, the muscle was isolated without microvascular clamp being applied.     The incision wound was closed with interrupted sutures (4-0 nylon) and the animals were allowed to awaken in the remaining periods of reperfusion.     The harvested muscles were frozen in isopentane chilled in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. For the miRNA array experiments, the isolated skeletal muscles of C57BL/6 mice after 2 h of ischemia and 0 h, 4 h, 1 d, and 7 d of reperfusion as well as of Tlr4–/–and NF-κB–/– mice after 2 h of ischemia and 1 d of reperfusion were used in 3 replicate experiments.
 E-GEOD-53946 - Affymetrix gene expression of Transitional Type-1 B-cells from Wild-type (CBA), Xid and Btk KO mice Splenic Transitional Type-1 B-cells from CBA wild-type mice, X-linked immunodeficiency mice and Bruton's tyrosine kinase knock-out mice.     Two replicates where run on Affymetrix 420 2.0 arrays for CBA wild-type,  Xid samples and the Btk KO samples.     Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase important for B-lymphocyte maturation.     Mutations in Btk give rise to the primary immunodeficiency disease X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) in man and X-linked immunodeficiency (Xid) in mice.     Recent studies have subdivided the mouse immature, or transitional, B-cells into two distinct subsets according to their respective surface markers.     Transitional type 1 (T1) and transitional type 2 (T2) cells are also located in distinct anatomic locations.     Based on a limited number of markers it has previously been reported that the earliest phenotypic sign of Btk deficiency is manifested at the T2 stage in mice.     Here, we report on distinct genome-wide transcriptomic signature differences found in T1 B-lymphocytes from Btk-defective compared to normal mice and demonstrate that Btk deficiency is visible already at this stage.     2 replicates of T1 B-cells from CBA (WT), Xid samples and the Btk KO samples
 E-GEOD-49038 - NRASG12V mediates leukemia self renewal [Microarray] Mutant RAS oncoproteins activate signaling molecules that drive oncogenesis in multiple human tumors including acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). However, the specific function of these pathways in AML is unclear.     To elucidate the downstream functions of activated NRAS in AML, we employed a murine model of AML harboring Mll-AF9 and NRASG12V. We found that NRASG12V enforced leukemia self-renewal gene expression signatures and was required to maintain an MLL-AF9 and MYB-dependent gene expression program.     In a multiplexed analysis of RAS-dependent signaling intermediates, the leukemia stem cell compartment was preferentially sensitive to RAS withdrawal.     Use of RAS-pathway inhibitors showed that NRASG12V maintained leukemia self-renewal through mTOR and MEK pathway activation, implicating these pathways as potential targets for cancer stem cell-specific therapies.     Mice harboring NRASG12V/Mll-AF9 AML were treated with doxycyline to abolish NRASG12V expression.      Leukemia samples were harvested at 12 hour intervals after doxycyline treatment.      RNA was extracted from these samples and submitted for gene expression microarray analysis
 E-GEOD-65472 - Identification of IL-22 regulated genes in the ileum after infection with Toxoplasma gondii IL-22 acts on epithelial cells and has been shown to induce tissue protective and wound healing responses in these cells.     But it has recently been decribed that IL-22 exacerbates ileatis after infection with T. gondii.     The goal of the study is to identify the IL-22-dependent genes during T. gondii infection in order to understand why IL-22 is pathogenic in this context.     one experimental condition, 5 mice per group, 2 groups: WT and IL-22 KO animals
 E-GEOD-35979 - Gene expression data from IL13-induced allergic airway inflammation of mice lungs Asthma is a common chronic inflammatory airway condition with a strong genetic and inheritability component, as siblings and first-degree relatives of those with the disease are often affected.     For our studies, we used a well-characterized transgenic mouse model of allergic airway inflammation induced by IL13. In this model, IL13 is conditionally overexpressed in the mouse lung when treated with doxycycline.     Upon IL13 induction, these mice showed inflammatory cell infiltration, pronounced emphysema, increased pulmonary compliance, lung volume enlargement, mucus metaplasia, and increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases and cathepsins in the lung.     We performed gene expression microarray to examine the changes in gene expression during IL13-induced allergic airway inflammation.     The CC10-rtTA-IL13 transgenic (TG) and wildtype (WT) mice were treated with doxycycline for seven days.     Mice were euthanized and the left upper lobes from all mice were removed for RNA extraction using the TRIzol method.
 E-GEOD-5236 - Transcription profiling of mouse expressing human Cathepsin L inhibitor hurpin, skin alterations and increased carcinogenesis. Aim of this study was to identify gene expression differences in the skin of hurpin (=headpin=serpinB13) transgenic mice in comparison to wildtype mice.      Experiment Overall Design: Comparison of 4 transgenic mice with 3 wildtype mice.     One wildtye sample was used two times.     Experiment Overall Design: Age: 8 month.      Experiment Overall Design: Gender: mixed (male and female)
 E-MEXP-2794 - Transcription profiling by array of mouse promyelocyte granulocytes with activated MYC-ER protein The mouse promyelocyte (MPRO) granulocyte cell model expressing the MYC-ER fusion protein encoding transgene was used as a system to perform gene expression profiling in a granulocytic cell setting of low endogenous MYC expression (differentiated MYC-ER MPROs, D4) where we then activated the MYC-ER protein for 24 h with 4-OHT (D5T) as compared to a EtOH vehicle treated control (D5E).
 E-GEOD-18824 - Expression data from 17 day old testes of wild type and UBR2-/- mice Ubiquitylation of histones provides an important mechanism regulating chromatin remodeling and gene expression.     Recent studies have revealed ubiquitin ligases involved in histone ubiquitylation, yet the responsible enzymes and the function of histone ubiquitination in spermatogenesis remain unclear.     Here we show that the ubiquitin ligase UBR2, one of the recognition E3 components of the N-end rule proteolytic pathway, localizes to meiotic chromatin regions, including unsynapsed axial elements linked to chromatin inactivation, and mediates, in combination with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme HR6B, the ubiquitination of histone H2A. UBR2 interacts with HR6B and H2A and promotes the HR6B-H2A interaction and the HR6B-to-H2A transfer of ubiquitin.     UBR2 and ubiquitinated H2A (uH2A) spatiotemporally mark meiotic chromatin regions subject to transcriptional silencing, and UBR2-deficient spermatocytes fail to induce the ubiquitination of H2A during meiosis.     UBR2-deficient spermatocytes are profoundly impaired in transcriptional silencing of genes linked to unsynapsed axes of the X and Y chromosomes.     We propose a model, in which UBR2 on axial elements of the X-Y pair enables HR6B on the linked chromatin domain to repeat histone ubiquitination cycles while scanning a string of nucleosomes.     Our results suggest that histone ubiquitination in germ cells may be mediated by E3-E2 pairs distinct from those in somatic cells, providing a new insight into chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation.     For each genotype, 2 testes were collected from different individual in same litter at 17 days old.     Biotinylated cRNA was produced and hybridized on Affimetrix mouse genome 430A 2.0 array.
 E-GEOD-37415 - Phloridzin reduces blood glucose levels and alters hepatic gene expression in normal BALB/c mice We previously showed that a diet containing phloridzin suppressed the blood glucose levels in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice most likely by inhibiting glucose absorption from the small intestine.     In this study, we showed that 0.5% and 1% phloridzin diets significantly reduce the blood glucose levels in healthy normal BALB/c mice after 7 days of feeding.     To understand the effect of the high continuing intake of dietary phloridzin on normal mouse livers, we analyzed the hepatic gene expressions in mice fed diets containing 0%, 0.1%, 0.5%, or 1% phloridzin for 14 days using DNA microarrays.     Six-week-old male mice were divided into 4 groups of 6 mice each, housed in groups of 3 per cage, and fed a standard purified AIN-93G diet containing 0% (Con), 0.1% (Phlorizin0.1), 0.5% (Phlorizin0.5), or 1% phloridzin (purity   97%)  (Phlorizin1.0) for 2 weeks.
 E-GEOD-17580 - PRONOUNCED PHENOTYPE IN ACTIVATED TREG CELLS DURING A CHRONIC HELMINTH INFECTION Although several markers have been associated with the characterization of regulatory T cells (Treg) and their function, no studies have investigated the dynamics of their phenotype during infection.     Since the necessity of Treg to control immunopathology has been demonstrated, we used the chronic helminth infection model S. mansoni to address the impact on the Treg gene repertoire.     Before gene expression profiling we first chose to study the localization and antigen-specific suppressive nature of classically defined Treg during infection.     Presence of Foxp3+ cells were found especially in the periphery of granulomas and isolated CD4+CD25hiFoxp3+ Treg from infected mice blocked IFN-gamma and IL-10 cytokine secretion from infected CD4+CD25- effector T cells (Teff). Furthermore the gene expression patterns of Treg and Teff showed that in total 474 genes were significantly regulated during chronic schistosomiasis.     Upon k-means clustering we identified genes exclusively regulated in all four populations including Foxp3, CD103, GITR, OX40 and CTLA-4: classical Treg markers.     During infection however, several non-classical genes were up-regulated solely within the Treg population such as Slpi, Gzmb, Mt1, Fabp5, Nfil3, Socs2, Gpr177 and Klrg1. Using RT-PCR we confirmed aspects of the microarray data and in addition showed that the expression profile of Treg from S. mansoni-infected mice is simultaneously unique and comparative with Treg derived from other infections Regulatory T cells (Treg) or effector T cells (Teff) were FACS-sorted as CD4+CD25+ or CD4+CD25- from mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) of naive mice or from mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni.     Affymetrix MOE430A 2.0 genechips were used to identify genes differentially expressed in Treg or Teff under resting or infected conditions.
 E-GEOD-17263 - Gene expression profiling of constitutive activation of Smoothened in the mouse uterus In order to gain a better understanding of Ihh action during embryo implantation, we constitutively activated Smo in the murine uterus using the PRcre mouse model (PRcre/+SmoM2+; SmoM2).  Female SmoM2 mice were infertile.     They exhibited normal serum progesterone levels and normal ovulation, but ova failed to be fertilized in vivo and the uterus failed to undergo the artificially induced decidual response.      SmoM2 mice exhibited uterine hypertrophy.      The endometrium had a reduced number of uterine glands and the endometrial stroma lost its normal morphologic characteristics.      Microarray analysis of 3 month old SmoM2 uteri demonstrated a chondrocytic signature and confirmed that constitutive activation of SmoM2 increased extracellular matrix production.      Thus, constitutive activation of Smo in the mouse uterus alters the extracellular matrix which interferes with early pregnancy.      Keywords: two group comparison We constitutively activated Hh signaling in the uterus by the expression of a mutant SmoM2 allele.     We crossed these mice to the PRcre mouse model to constitutively activate Smo in the murine uterus (PRcre/+SmoM2+; SmoM2). High density DNA microarray analysis was performed on 3 month old control and SmoM2 uteri.
 E-GEOD-15118 - Transcription profiling of mouse cartilage tumours IGFBP-3 reveals is regulated by Gli signaling in cartilage tumors. Mice that develop benign cartilage lesions due to overexpression of Gli2 in chondrocytes developed lesions similar to chondrosarcomas when also deficient in p53.  Gli2 overexpression and p53 deficiency had opposing effects on chondrocyte differentiation, but had additive effects negatively regulating apoptosis.      Regulation of Igfbp3 expression and IGF signaling by Gli and p53 integrated their effect on apoptosis.      Treatment of human chondrosarcomas or fetal mouse limbs explants with IGFBP3 or by blocking IGF increased the apoptosis rate, and mice expressing Gli2 developed substantially fewer tumors when also deficient for Igf2.  IGF signaling meditated apoptosis regulates the progression to malignant chondrosarcoma.     Experiment Overall Design: The CH10T1/2 cell line was stably transfected with either the R150C variant PTHR1 present in enchondromas (Hopyan, S., Gokgoz, N., Poon, R., Gensure, R. C., Yu, C., Cole, W. G., Bell, R. S., Juppner, H., Andrulis, I. L., Wunder, J. S., and Alman, B. A. (2002). A mutant PTH/PTHrP type I receptor in enchondromatosis.     Nat Genet 30, 306-310)  or a wild type PTHR1, as previously reported (Mau, E., Whetstone, H., Yu, C., Hopyan, S., Wunder, J. S., and Alman, B. A. (2007). PTHrP regulates growth plate chondrocyte differentiation and proliferation in a Gli3 dependent manner utilizing hedgehog ligand dependent and independent mechanisms.     Dev Biol 305, 28-39).  Cells were grown overnight in serum free media and treated with either 10− 7 M PTHrP (Bachem, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, USA), or carrier alone for one hour.      RNA was isolated from the cells CH10T1/2 cells expressing either the R150C variant PTHR1 or wild type PTHR1.  RNA was converted to double-stranded cDNA using Superscript (Gibco-Invitrogen) with a T7-(dT)24 primer, which was then transcribed to biotinylated complementary RNA (cRNA) by incorporating biotin-CTP and biotin-UTP using Enzo BioArray High Yield RNA labeling kit (Enzo Diagnostics, New York, NY). The cRNA labeling and hybridizations were then performed according to Affymetrix GeneChip Protocol (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). The chips were scanned for fluorescence signal detection.     Affymetrix - GeneChip® Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 Array was utilized.
 E-GEOD-41706 - Expression data from adult (9 month-old) hearts from GRK2 heterozygous C57BL/6J mice and its wild type littermates G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) has emerged as a key regulator of cardiac function and myocardial structure.     Cardiac GRK2 is increased in heart failure and ischemia in humans, whereas genetic inhibition of GRK2 is cardioprotective in animal models of these pathologies.     However, the mechanistic basis underlying these effects are not fully understood.     We have used adult GRK2 hemizygous mice (GRK2+/-) as a model to assess the effects of a sustained systemic inhibition of GRK2 in heart tissue with age.     We used microarrays to determine the global programme of gene expression underlying cardioprotection in GRK2 hemizygous mice.     9 month-old mice hearts were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
 E-GEOD-4866 - Transcription profiling by array of cochlea from PolgD257A/D257A mice Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations may contribute to aging and age-related disorders.     Previously, we created mice expressing a proofreading-deficient version of the mtDNA polymerase gamma (Polg) which accumulate age-related mtDNA mutations and display premature aging.     Here we performed microarray gene expression profiling to identify mtDNA mutation-responsive genes in the cochlea of aged mitochondrial mutator mice.     Age-related accumulation of mtDNA mutations was associated with transcriptional alternations consistent with reduced inner ear function, mitochondrial dysfunction, neurodegeneration, and reduced cell structural modulation.     Hearing assessment and histopathological results confirmed that aged PolgD257A/D257A (D257A) mice exhibited moderate hearing loss and severe cochlear degenerations.     Age-related accumulation of mtDNA mutations also resulted in alternations in gene expression consistent with induction of apoptosis, proteolysis, stress response, and reduced DNA repair.     TUNEL (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling) assay confirmed that the cochleae from aged D257A mice showed significantly more TUNEL positive cells compared to wild-type (WT) mice.     The levels of cleaved caspase-3 were also found to increase in the cochleae of aged D257A mice.     These observations provide evidence that age-related accumulation of mtDNA mutations is associated with apoptotic cell death in aged cochlea.     Our results provide the first global view of molecular events associated with mtDNA mutations in postmitotic tissue, and suggest that apoptosis is the major mechanism of mtDNA mediated cell death in the development of age-related hearing disorder.     Experiment Overall Design: To determine the effects of age-related accumulation of mtDNA mutations, each WT sample (n = 5) was compared to each D257A sample (n = 5), generating a total of twenty-five pairwise comparisons.     Genes with significantly altered expression levels were sorted into gene ontology biological process categories.      Experiment Overall Design: Gene expression change was called statistically significant when at least one gene was called present in a group, the P value was   0.0500, FC was   1.1, and FDR was   30.00 for identification of mtDNA mutations-induced genes.      Experiment Overall Design: Affymetrix standard spike controls were used in all experiments (eukaryotic hybridization control kit). Quality control measures were not used.     No replicates were done.     Dye swap was not used.
 E-GEOD-12610 - Transcription profiling of mouse retina after induction of diabetes Diabetes is a disease now affecting more than 20 million people in the United States alone.      When left untreated it has numerous debilitating effects including diabetic retinopathy, which is characterized by the death of retinal neurons as well as a breakdown of the retinal vascularization.      This leads to nearly 24,000 cases of blindness each year among diabetic patients.      Studies have shown the importance of both nitric oxide and the gene VEGF in retinopathy, however little is known about the condition's progression.      This study would determine which genes are affected early in diabetes and more generally, give insite into how neural degeneration occurs in the retina.     We aim to show the gene-level changes in the diabetic mouse retina five weeks after induction of diabetes.      Our laboratory's primary focus is on NO production through nNOS, iNOS and endothelial (eNOS).  We hope to be able to correlate some of the transcript level changes with genes known to be involved in the NO signalling pathways.     Previous data by our lab and others have shown that neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS) are upregulated under diabetic conditions in the retina.      Additional work in our lab has shown that the lack of  nitric oxide (NO) produced by nNOS may affect neurotransmitter production, particularly with GABA.  We have also shown that mice with induced diabetes show neurochemical changes in the retina after only one to three weeks.      Thus, we expect to see gene level changes associated with the retina before psysological changes in newly diabetic mice.     Adult CD1 mice of random sexes are injected with the drug streptozotocin on three successive days while fasting 8 hours before the injection.      This drug selectivley destroys  the beta-islet cells of the pancrease.      Their blood sugar levels are then tested after a resting period.      Mice with glucose levels above 250mg/dL are considered diabetic from the date of the last injection.     Mice are then sacrificed after the waiting period by breif isoflourine inhalation followed by decapitation.      Retinas are immediately removed in cold HBSS and RNA is extracted using Trizol extraction.      To get adequate amounts of RNA, we will pool four retinas (2 animals) together.
 E-GEOD-21718 - Developmental influence of the cellular prion protein on the gene expression profile in mouse hippocampus A key event in the pathogenic process of prion diseases is the conversion of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) to an abnormal and protease-resistant isoform (PrPSc). Mice lacking PrP are resistant to prion infection, and down-regulation of PrPC during prion infection prevents neuronal loss and the progression to clinical disease.     These results are suggestive of the potential beneficial effect of silencing PrPC during prion diseases.     However, the silencing of a protein that is widely expressed throughout the CNS could be detrimental to brain homeostasis.     The physiological role of PrPC remains still unclear, but several putative functions have been proposed.     Among these, several lines of evidence support PrPC function in neuronal development and maintenance.     To assess the influence of PrPC on gene expression profile during development in the mouse brain, we undertook a microarray analysis by using RNA isolated from the hippocampus, at two different developmental stages: newborn (4-day-old) and adult (3-month-old) mice, both from Prnp+/+ and Prnp0/0 animals.     The comparison of the different datasets allowed us to identify “commonly” co-regulated genes and “uniquely” de-regulated genes during postnatal development in these animal models.      The lack of PrPC during neuronal development affected several biological pathways, among which the most representative were cell signaling, cell-cell communication and transduction process.     In addition, the absence of PrPC influenced genes involved in calcium homeostasis, nervous system development, synaptic transmission and cell adhesion.     There was only a moderate alteration of the gene expression profile during neuronal development in the animal models we studied.     PrPC deficiency does not lead to a dramatic alteration of gene expression profile, and produces moderate altered gene expression levels from young to adult animals.     Thus, our results may provide additional support to silencing endogenous PrPC levels as a therapeutic approach to prion diseases.     To analyze the influence of PrPC expression on CNS gene expression profile during development, we investigated WT PrPC (Prnp+/+) and Prnp0/0 mice at two different developmental stages: in neonatal animals (postnatal day 4, P4) and in adult animals (3 months old). For each developmental stage, hippocampi of 3 (pups) or 4 (adult) animals were dissected immediately after animal sacrifice and promptly processed for RNA extraction and purification, for a total of 14 samples.
 E-GEOD-27717 - Expression data from lung tumors of KrasTgfbr2 -/- mouse model Recent data suggests that repression of the Type II TGF-B Receptor (Tgfr2) repression in human lung adenocarcinoma is important for progression from noninvasive to invasive adenocarcinoma.     To test this hypothesis in a animal model of non-invasive lung cancer, we generated an inducible, lung specific Tgfbr2 knockout model in the oncogenic Kras mouse.     LSL-KrasG12D positive mice were simultaneously backcrossed to C57/Bl6 mice and to the Tgfbr2 flox/flox mice.     To induce tumors, 100  l of saline containing 3x10e10 particles of an adenovirus containing the Cre recombinase (Ad.Cre) was administered to each LSL-KrasG12D mouse intra-nasally.     Mice were sacrificed at 7 weeks after administration of Adeno-Cre.  We used laser capture microdissection to acquire tumor cells from KrasTgfbr2-/-  and KrasTgfbr2 wt mouse tumors.
 E-GEOD-47872 - Integrated analysis identifies key determinants of embryonic stem cell identity and homeostasis Despite RNAi-based screens to uncover genes controlling embryonic stem cell (ESC) identity, the pluripotency network remains poorly characterized, as does the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the balance between self-renewal and differentiation.     Here we carried out a systematic meta-analysis of published gene expression data to rank-order genes based on their likelihood of regulating ESC identity.     Not only did our analysis correctly rank known pluripotency-associated genes atop the list, but it also helped unearth many novel determinants of ESC identity including several components of functionally distinct complexes, as determined using RNAi. We focus on our top-hit Nucleolin, and characterize its mechanistic role in the maintenance of ESC homeostasis by shielding from differentiation-inducing redox imbalance-induced oxidative stress.     Notably, we identify a conceptually novel mechanism involving a Nucleolin-dependent bistable switch regulating the homeostatic balance between self-renewal and differentiation in ESCs. Our gene ranks represent a rich and valuable resource for uncovering novel ESC regulators.

 E-GEOD-9025 - A novel approach to investigate tissue-specific trinucleotide repeat instability - A validation set of prediction model In Huntington’s disease (HD), an expanded CAG repeat produces characteristic striatal neurodegeneration.     Interestingly, the HD CAG repeat, whose length determines age at onset, undergoes tissue-specific somatic instability, predominant in the striatum, suggesting that tissue-specific CAG length changes could modify the disease process.     Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying the tissue specificity of somatic instability may provide novel routes to therapies.     However progress in this area has been hampered by the lack of sensitive high-throughput instability quantification methods and global approaches to identify the underlying factors.      Here we describe a novel approach to gain insight into the factors responsible for the tissue specificity of somatic instability.     Using accurate genetic knock-in mouse models of HD, we developed a reliable, high-throughput method to quantify tissue HD CAG instability and integrated this with genome-wide bioinformatic approaches.     Using tissue instability quantified in 16 tissues as a phenotype and tissue microarray gene expression as a predictor, we built a mathematical model and identified a gene expression signature that accurately predicted tissue instability.     Using the predictive ability of this signature we found that somatic instability was not a consequence of pathogenesis.     In support of this, genetic crosses with models of accelerated neuropathology failed to induce somatic instability.     In addition, we searched for genes and pathways that correlated with tissue instability.     We found that expression levels of DNA repair genes did not explain the tissue specificity of somatic instability.     Instead, our data implicate other pathways, particularly cell cycle, metabolism and neurotransmitter pathways, acting in combination to generate tissue-specific patterns of instability.      Our study clearly demonstrates that multiple tissue factors reflect the level of somatic instability in different tissues.     In addition, our quantitative, genome-wide approach is readily applicable to high-throughput assays and opens the door to widespread applications with the potential to accelerate the discovery of drugs that alter tissue instability.

 E-GEOD-25645 - Ebf1 or Pax5 Haploinsufficiency Synergizes with STAT5 Activation to Initiate Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia STAT5 is critical for differentiation, proliferation and survival of progenitor B cells suggesting a possible role in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Herein, we show increased expression of activated STAT5 in ALL patients, which correlates with treatment outcome.      Mutations in Ebf1 and Pax5, genes critical for B cell development have also been identified in human ALL.  To determine whether mutations in Ebf1 or Pax5 synergize with STAT5 activation to induce ALL we crossed mice expressing a constitutively active form of STAT5 (Stat5b-CA) with mice heterozygous for Ebf1 or Pax5. Haploinsufficiency of either Pax5 or Ebf1 synergized with Stat5b-CA to rapidly induce ALL in 100% of the mice.     The leukemic cells displayed reduced expression of both Pax5 and Ebf1 but this had little affect on most EBF1 or PAX5 target genes.      However, a subset of these genes was deregulated and included a large percentage of potential tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes.      Further, most of these genes appear to be jointly regulated by both EBF1 and PAX5.  Our findings suggest a model whereby small perturbations in a self-reinforcing network of transcription factors critical for B cell development, specifically PAX5 and EBF1, cooperate with STAT5 activation to initiate ALL. Gene expression profiling was performed on cells isolated from lymph nodes of Stat5b-CA x Ebf1+/- and Stat5b-CA x Rag2-/- leukemic mice and pre B cells sorted from bone marrow of C57BL/6 mice and Stat5b-CA transgenic mice.     17 Samples.
 E-GEOD-25637 - A mouse model of deregulation of the malt1 oncogene recapitulates the pathogenesis of human malt lymphoma [Spleen dataset] Attempts at modeling chromosomal translocations involving MALT1 gene, hallmarks of human mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, have failed to reproduce the disease in mice.     Here we describe a transgenic model in which MALT1 expression was targeted to mouse hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.     In Sca1-MALT1 mice, MALT1 deregulation activated the NF-kappaB pathway in Sca1+ cells, promoting selective B-cell differentiation and mature lymphocyte accumulation in extranodal tissues, progressively leading to the development of clonal B-cell lymphomas.     These tumors recapitulated the histopathological features of human MALT lymphomas, presenting typical lymphoepithelial lesions and plasmacytic differentiation.     Transcriptional profiling of Sca1-MALT1 murine lymphomas revealed overlapping molecular signatures with human MALT lymphomas, including MALT1-mediated NFkappaB activation, pro-inflammatory signaling and XBP1-induced plasmacytic differentiation.     Moreover, murine Malt1 showed proteolytic activity by cleaving Bcl10 in Sca1-MALT1 lymphomas.     Our novel technological approach has allowed modeling human MALT lymphoma in mice, which represent unique tools study MALT lymphoma biology and evaluate anti-MALT1 therapies.      Keywords: Genetic modification, wt vs. transgenic, disease analysis, MALT lymphoma 9 samples were analized of which 5 were splenic lymphomas from Sca1-MALT1 transgenic mice and 4 were spleens from WT mice.
 E-GEOD-71319 - Expression data of sorted GFP+ and tdTomato+ prostate tumor cells from Pten/Smad4/mTmG mice Single cells from Ptenpc-/-Smad4pc-/-mTmG+ prostate tumors were isolated into single cells which were FACS-sorted for GFP+ and Tomato+ cells and RNA was purified with TRIzol (Life Technologies). RNA expression profiling was performed  using the Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (Affymetrix) to generate a Ptenpc-/-Smad4pc-/- tumor/Stroma dataset.     Two mice (9074, 9076) at 28 weeks old were used to isolate anterior prostate (AP) and dorsolateral prostate (DLP). From each prostate lobe, three populations were extracted for RNA: unsorted, GFP+, Tomato+. Therefore, there are total 12 samples.
 E-GEOD-43263 - Sleeping Beauty Expression data from mouse We extracted RNA of 39 mouse tissue of various genotypes and performed expression microarrays.      Subsequently a screen was conducted using the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon to identify breast cancer candidate genes.     39 mouse samples expression data.
 E-GEOD-78202 - Placental protein-1 (Plac1) modulates immune tolerance in mammary tumor cells Plac1 is an X-linked (Xq26) trophoblast gene expressed at high levels in the placenta, at low levels in the testis, but not in other normal somatic tissues.     However, it is re-expressed in several malignancies, including breast, colon, lung, gastric, liver and endometrial cancers as well as in most human cancer cell lines.     Plac1 contains HLA-A2-restricted epitopes capable of eliciting a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response against human breast cancer cells, and colorectal cancer patients with a Plac1-specific CTL response demonstrate long-term survival.     To explore the role of Plac1 in cancer, mouse mammary tumor E0771 cells expressing high levels of Plac1 were transduced with a lentivirus expressing a Plac1 shRNA (E0771/shPlac1). The RNeasy Mini Kit was used to purify total RNA from three independent cell culture samples for gene expression analysis.     After isolation in parallel, 1 μg of each of the total RNA from E0771/Scram or E0771/Shplac1 was pooled prior to microarray gene expression analysis.     E0771/Scram was considered as control group in this experiment.
 E-GEOD-68298 - Expression data from aging study on mouse spermatogonial stem/progenitor cell population In mouse, spermatogonial stem/progenitor cells are the progenitor cell which develop to mature sperms through a series of mitotic and meiotic divisions and differentiation.     Gfra1 is an established surface marker for mouse spermatogonial stem/progenitor cells.     In this study, we used a transcriptomic approach to investigate the effect of aging on Gfra1-positive and -negative populations of mouse male germ cells.     Spermatogonial stem/progenitor cells were isolated from testes of mice at ages 6-day, 21-day, 60-day, and 8-months by magnetic assisted cell sorting (MACS) technique using Gfra1 marker.     Transcriptomes among different ages and Gfra1 status were compared.
 E-MTAB-2863 - Transcription profiling by array of CD11C+ splenic dendritic cells from young (8 weeks) and old (110 weeks) mice treated with Poly I:C for 4 hours Total RNA was isolated from FACS purified CD11c+ splenic DC populations isolated from young (8 weeks old, n=3) and aged (110 weeks old, n=3) mice, that had been injected with Poly I:C for 4h previously.     Microarray analysis was performed with the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays.     The arrays were hybridized, washed and scanned according to the standard Affymetrix protocol.     The gene chip tests were performed by professional staff of Shanghai Biochip Company, PRC. Gene expression profiles and functional gene set enrichment analysis demonstrate that DC isolated aged mice are impaired in their ability to activate Natural Killer (NK) cells.     The study is submitted for publication in June 2014.
 E-GEOD-34324 - Gene expression by Retinoic Acid in mouse Dendritic Cells The purpose of this study was to determine and clarify the retinoic effect on the gene expression profile for mouse dendritic cells.       Dendritic cells were prepared from marrow cells by culturing them for 10 days with GM-CSF (20 ng/ml). These cells were cultured with the following reagents from the beginning of the culture: Two groups of dendritic cell conditions (Control, all-trans-retinoic acid (10 nmol) and Ro41-5253 (100 nmol)) with and without LPS(1 ug/ml).  The above conditions were done in BALB/c and BL6 mouse strains and compared for reproducible gene expression.

 E-GEOD-9343 - Transcription profiling of mammary tissues from mouse model of breast cancer conditionally expressing Etv6-NTRK3 (EN) fusion oncoprotein, the product of the t(12;15)(p13;q25) translocation For the largest class of human tumors, those of epithelial origin, little is known about their initiating genetic hits or cells of origin.      Whether tissue stem cells or more committed progenitors are targets for transformation is also uncertain.     Experience in hematopoietic malignancies and sarcomas teaches that recurrent chromosomal translocations represent initiating oncogenic events.     To develop a system in which epithelial tumorigenesis can be assessed from the initial event to frank malignancy, we have generated mice that conditionally express the Etv6-NTRK3 (EN) fusion oncoprotein, the product of the t(12;15)(p13;q25) translocation characteristic of one form of human breast cancer.     Activation of EN expression in mammary tissues by Whey acidic protein (Wap) promoter-driven Cre leads to fully penetrant, multifocal malignant breast cancer with short latency.     We provide genetic evidence that committed, bipotent or CD61+ luminal alveolar progenitors, can be targets of tumorigenesis.     Furthermore, EN transforms these otherwise transient progenitors through the AP1 complex.     Our model supports the existence of an epithelial cell hierarchy in both normal mammary glands and malignancy.     To our knowledge, this is the first murine model of human epithelial cancer based on a recurrent chromosomal translocation.     Given increasing relevance of chromosomal translocations in epithelial cancers, such mice serve as a paradigm for the study of their genetic pathogenesis and cellular origins, and generation of novel preclinical models.      Experiment Overall Design: Reference X Sample
 E-GEOD-45646 - Expression data from mouse liver tumor-initiating cells The Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway is important for tumor-initiating cells.     We used microarrays to obtain gene profiling data in order to increase understanding of the pathways.     Liver tumor-initiating cells were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
 E-GEOD-9760 - Transcription profiling of mouse model of Huntingdons disease embryonic stem cells with expanded CAG repeats Huntingtons disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease, with out effective treatment.      Despite significant advances, our understanding of how an expanded CAG repeat in the amino terminus of the large ubiquitously expressed HD gene product remains incomplete.      Augmented adult neurogenesis in response to acute and chronic injury, including Huntingtons disease, has been demonstrated, but its role development, disease, and recovery is largely unknown, as are the factors controlling it.  The HD gene product, huntingtin (htt) is know to interact with a number of transcription factors which subsequently influence gene expression.      Understanding the factors involved in controlling neurogenesis in response to disease would bridge a significant knowledge gap and have tremendous therapeutic potential.     We propose to identify transcripts responsible for CAG repeat facilitated neurogenesis.     Our hypothesis is that expanded CAG repeats in the Huntingtons disease gene facilitates neurogenesis by altering transcription of genes critical in neurogenesis.     We have developed a model in which mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) with expanded CAG repeats have facilitated neurogenesis.      In this model more ESC with expanded CAG repeats transition to neuronal precursors and then develop into mature neurons more rapidly than control ESC.  We propose to compare the gene expression profiles between ESC with expanded CAG repeats and control ESCs on days 4 and 6 of neuronal differentiation.      Initial studies indicate that key transcriptional differences are occurring at these time points.      Control ECS and a an ESC line with150 CAG repeats will be differentiated in triplicate, and RNA isolated form each replicate.      It is anticipated that comparison of gene expression between the control and CAG repeat lines at each time point will identify transcripts involved in CAG repeat facilitated neurogenesis.      Observed differences at day 4 may be more relevant to the transition from ESC to neuronal precursor whereas differences at day 6 may be more relevant to the neuronal precursor to neuron transition.
 E-GEOD-32536 - Long-term pioglitazone improves learning and attenuates pathological markers in a mouse model of AD Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are agonists at peroxisome proliferator-activated gamma-type (PPAR-y) receptors and are used clinically for the treatment of type 2 diabetes where they have been shown to reestablish insulin sensitivity, improve lipids profile, and reduce inflammation.     Recent work also suggests that TZDs may be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease (AD), ameliorating cognitive decline early in the disease process.     However, there have been only a few studies identifying mechanisms through which cognitive benefits may be exerted.     Starting at 10 months of age, the triple transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD) with accelerated amyloid-B (AB) deposition and tau pathology was treated with the TZD pioglitazone (PIO- Actos) at 18 mg/Kg body weight/day.     After four months, PIO-treated animals showed multiple beneficial effects, including improved learning on the active avoidance task, reduced serum cholesterol, decreased hippocampal AB deposits, and enhanced short- and long-term plasticity.     Baseline electrophysiological membrane properties and blood glucose levels were unchanged by PIO treatment.     Gene microarray analyses of hippocampal tissue identified predicted transcriptional responses following TZD treatment as well as potentially novel targets of TZDs, including facilitation of estrogenic processes, and decreases in glutamatergic and ketone metabolic/ cholesterol dependent processes.     Taken together, these results confirm prior animal studies showing that TZDs can ameliorate cognitive deficits associated with AD-related pathology, but also extend these findings by pointing to novel molecular targets in the brain.     Keywords : Hippocampus; LTP; Microarray analysis; Avoidance learning; Aging; PPAR; Synaptic hyperpolarization; T2DM We used the 3xTg-AD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and monitored the effects of pioglitazone (PIO-Actos a TZD) on behavioral, electrophysiological, and molecular variables.     Emphasis was placed on identifying hippocampal PIO-sensitive genes that were also associated with learning and memory processes.     Starting at 10 months of age, female mice were treated for approximately 14 weeks with either a control diet or a PIO-containing diet.     PIO was incorporated into the diet to yield a final dose of approximately 18 mg/kg body weight/day.
 E-MEXP-3955 - Transcription profiling by array of mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells after treatment with human WNT1 Bone marrow (BM) cells derived from femurs of C57BL/6 mice were used to generate BM-DCs. For this, BM cells (2x106 cells/10 ml) were seeded on 100 mm2 bacterial dishes (Greiner bio-one, Frickenhausen, Germany). DC culture media (IMDM, 5% [v/v] FCS [PAA, Coelbe, Germany], 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin [both Gibco, Paisly, UK], 50 uM beta-mercaptoethanol [Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany] 5% [v/v] of murine GM-CSF containing cell culture supernatant  was replenished on days 3 and 6 of culture.     Aliquots of DC cultures were treated with recombinant human 100 ng/ml WNT-1 (Biovision, Milpitas, CA) for 48h  on days 7 or 8 of culture.     Each 20 ug of total RNA derived from unstimulated BM-DCs treated for 48 h with WNT-1 (100 ng/ml) or left untreated was used for generation of fluorescecne-labeled cDNA probes (Alexa Fluor 555-aha-dUTP for untreated BM-DCs; Alexa Fluor 647-aha-dUTP for WNT-treated BM-DCs).  br  br  br  br Prehybridized (5X SSPE,0.1% SDS, and 1% BSA) microarrays (Mouse Whole Genome OneArray Microarray v2; Phalanx Biotech, San Diego, U.S.A.) were hybridized with each 20 pmol of either fluorescence-labeled cDNA probe using OneArray Hybridization Buffer with 18% formamide for 16 h (Lucidea SlidePro Hybridizer; GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany) according to the OneArray hybridization protocol.     Washed microarrays were analysed using a ScanArray 4000 system equipped with ScanArray 4.0 software (both Perkin-Elmer; Rodgau-Jugesheim, Germany) at 10 pixel size.     Laser intensity (90-100%) and photomultiplier tube sensitivity (60-70%) were varied to optimize signal to background ratios.     Derived images weere analyzed using the ScanArray 4.0 easyquant software module.     Intensity data were normalized (loess normalization; MIDAS-2.19) and subjected to significance analysis (MEV 4.3) using appropriate modules of the TM4 microarray software suite.     Changes in gene expression with p   5% were used for subsequent analyses.     Gene ontology annotations were performed with Panther software (Thomas et al., 2003).
 E-GEOD-69928 - Systematic analysis of time resolved transcriptional signature of the cross-talk between HGF and IL-6 refines the role of Cxcl10 in hepatocyte proliferation control Liver regeneration is characterized by a scheduled sequence of inner and intra-cellular signaling events.     It starts with an initial inflammatory phase, followed by a period of rapidly proliferating hepatocytes and stopping abruptly when the liver mass is restored.     The cytokines hepatocellular growth factor (HGF) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) play a pivotal role during this process with the former driving proliferation that is enhanced by the latter.     While the individual importance of HGF and IL6 has been studied comprahensively the role of cross-talk in control of hepatic proliferation is jet largely unknown.     To this end, we performed time-resolved transcriptional profiling of of murine hepatocytes stimulated with HGF and IL-6 indiviually as well as in combination.     Thorough systematic investigation performing statistical analysis, mathematical formalization of cross-talk effects on the transcriptional level as well as gene-regulatory network inference revealed the transcriptional program of the cross-talk initiated by HGF and IL-6. Using the proliferation associated Hepcidin (Hamp) and Amphiregulin  (Areg) as marker genes for liver regeneration we perform exthensive in-silico experiments with the inferred gene-regulatory network for the identification of the most important players in regulation of the proliferation process.     Among other genes, this predicted chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (Cxcl10) as an important factor in the temporal regulation of proliferation.     These predictions were validated by independent in vitro expression data as well as independent in vivo literature data.     While Cxcl10 is known to be involved in liver regeneration, our study extend its role towards its temporal orchestration.     Cells were stimulated with either 40 ng/ml rmHGF (all R&D Systems) or 40 ng/ml rhIL-6 alone or in combination.     Cells were left untreated as unstimulated control.     RNA from three biological triplicates was extracted at 0, 0.5, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24 and 32 hours after stimulation using the RNeasy Mini Plus Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
 E-GEOD-2250 - Effects of irradiation on mouse lung Total lung RNA from 3 mouse strains after 18Gy thoracic irradiation.     Thoracic cavity radiotherapy is limited by the development of alveolitis and fibrosis in susceptible patients.      To define the response to 18 Gy pulmonary irradiation in mice, at the expression level, and to identify pathways which may influence the alveolitis and fibrosis phenotypes expression profiling was completed.      Male mice of three strains, A/J (late alveolitis response), C3H/HeJ (C3H, early alveolitis response) and C57BL/6J (B6, fibrosis response) were exposed to thoracic radiation, euthanised when moribund and lung tissue gene expression was assessed with microarrays.     treated vs. control in 3 strains
 E-GEOD-58170 - Separation of mouse ES cell-derived mesodermal cells based on the expression of Flk1, PDGFRa and CAR. We found that mouse ES cell-derived Flk1+ cells could be subdivided into three population by the expression of PDGFRa and CAR (Flk1+PDGFRa-CAR-, Flk1+PDGFRa-CAR+, and Flk1+PDGFRa+CAR+).   Therefore, global gene expression analysis was perfomed by microarray to characterize these mesodermal subsets.     RNA isolated from five separate experiments was pooled and used for comparison
 E-GEOD-15062 - Transcription profiling of mouse aorta smooth muscle cells reveals they differentiate into lymphoid tissue organizers upon combined TNFR1/LTBR NF-kB signaling Mouse aorta smooth muscle cells (SMCs) express TNF receptor superfamily member 1A (TNFR1) and lymphotoxin ß receptor (LTßR). Circumstantial evidence has linked the SMC LTßR to tertiary lymphoid organogenesis in diseased aortae of hyperlipidemic mice.     Here, we explored potential roles of TNFR1 and LTßR activation in cultured SMCs. TNFR1 signaling by TNF activated the classical RelA NF-κB pathway, whereas LTßR signaling by agonistic anti LTßR antibody activated both the classical RelA and alternative RelB NF-κB pathways.     Addition of both agonists synergized to enhance p100 inhibitor processing to the p52 subunit of NF-κB and promoted its nuclear translocation suggesting RelA-RelB cross-talk in transcription regulation.     Correspondingly, microarrays showed that simultaneous TNFR1 and LTßR activation when compared to activation of single receptors was followed by markedly elevated levels of mRNAs encoding leukocyte homeostatic chemokines CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1, and CX3CL1. Furthermore, SMCs acquired prototypical features of mesenchymal cells known as lymphoid tissue organizers (LTOs), which control tertiary lymphoid organogenesis in autoimmune diseases, through hyperinduction of CCL7, CCL9, CXCL13, CCL19, CXCL16, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1. Experiments with ltbr-/- SMCs suggested that the LTßR-RelB activation component of NF-κB signaling was obligatory to generate the LTO phenotype.     TNFR1-LTßR crosstalk also resulted in augmented synthesis and prolonged secretion of lymphorganogenic chemokine proteins into the culture medium.     Thus, combined TNFR1-LTßR signaling triggers SMC transdifferentiation into a phenotype that strikingly resembles LTOs. LTO-like SMCs may adopt a thus far unrecognized role in diseased arteries, i.e. to coordinate tertiary lymphoid organogenesis in atherosclerosis, aortic aneurysm, and transplant vasculopathy.     Experiment Overall Design: Smooth muscle cells in tissue culture were stimulated with agonists and subsequently microarray, RT-PCR, and protein assays / analyses were performed
 E-MEXP-1146 - Transcription profiling of mouse in vivo matured MII oocytes and fully in vivo grown germinal vesicle oocytes to identify gene transcripts linked to epigenetic reprogramming To elucidate some of the tools involved in early embryonic reprogramming, the levels of gene transcripts believed to be of importance to epigenetic modifications, and chromatin remodeling were detected by oligonucleotide microarrays in in vivo matured MII oocytes and compared with fully in vivo grown GV oocytes.
 E-GEOD-53299 - Expression data from mouse protein iPS cells compared to mouse embryonic stem cells and mouse hepatocyte. Increased genomic integrity an improved protein-based iPS cell method compared to current viral induced strategies We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression of protein-based iPS cells Total RNAs were prepared from mH, mES, miPS cells usingTRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and their cDNAs were allowed to hybridize to Affymetrix Mouse Expression Array 430 containing over 43,000 mouse transcripts at the Harvard Partners Center for Genomics and Genetics.
 E-GEOD-56928 - Global transcriptional profiling reveals distinct functions of thymic stromal subsets and age-related changes during thymic involution The thymic microenvironment is essential for proper differentiation and selection of thymocytes.Thymic involution in aged mice results in decreased T cell output and immune function.     Here we use gene expression profiling of FACS sorted thymic stromal subsets to identify molecular mediators of thymocyte: stromal cell interactions, as well as gene expression changes thymic stromal subsets during early stages of thymic involution . We used microarrays to analyze gene expression differences between thymic stromal subsets from male C57BL/6J mice 1, 3,  and 6 months of age.     Thymic stromal subsets (cTEC, mTEClo, mTEChi, Sirpa-DC, Sirpa+DC, and fibroblasts) were isolated from two 1-, 3-, and 6- month old male C57BL/6J mice.      After enzymatic digestion of the thymi, the stromal cells were FACS purified, and RNA was extracted, amplified, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix mouse 430 2.0 arraysarrays.     Raw data were uploaded to Gene Expression Commons for normalization.     Both raw CEL and normalized datasets from the 36 samples are included.     A model within Gene Expression Commons has been created for analyses/comparisons of these datasets, along with previously reported thymocyte subset datasets.     The model within Gene Expression Commons thus contains 6 thymic stromal populations, each from mice 1, 3, and 6 months of age, with duplicates for each datset.
 E-GEOD-34896 - Muscle specific proteasome deficient mice The ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosome pathways are the two major routes for protein and organelle clearance.     In skeletal muscle, both systems’ excessive activation induces severe muscle loss.     Although altered proteasomal function has been observed in various myopathies, the specific role of proteasomal activity in skeletal muscle has not been determined by loss-of-function approaches.     Here, we report that muscle-specific deletion of a crucial proteasomal gene, Rpt3, resulted in profound muscle atrophy and decrease in force.     Rpt3 null muscles showed reduced proteasomal activity in early age, accumulation of basophilic structure, disorganization of sarcomere, and formation of vacuoles and concentric membranous structures in electronmicroscope.     We also observed accumulation of ubiquitin, p62, LC3, TDP43, FUS and VCP proteins.     Proteasomal activity is important to preserve muscle mass and to maintain myofiber integrity.     Our results suggest that inhibition/alteration of proteasomal activity can contribute to myofiber degeneration and weakness in muscle disorders, such as inclusion body myositis, characterized by accumulation of abnormal inclusions.     Tibialis anterior muscles from Rpt3 null and control mice.     each 3 mice.
 E-GEOD-7707 - Transcription profiling of mouse multiple brain regions for a MPTP model of Parkinsons disease In Parkinson’s disease (PD), the progressive loss of substantia nigra dopamine cells has been associated with their vulnerability to oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction.     To identify multiple gene transcription alterations that may potentially underlie early stages of related degenerative processes in brain, we used the subcrhonic MPTP mouse model of PD and microarray analysis at 4 days post-MPTP when neurotoxic activity is maximal.     Since PD results in gene changes throughout the brain, we assessed MPTP's effects in multiple regions: frontal cortex, striatum and midbrain.     Experiment Overall Design: Mus musculus adults were randomly assigned to either MPTP or saline treatment groups.     Brain regions of interest (frontal cortex, striatum and midbrain) were dissected from both groups for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
 E-GEOD-15943 - Gene expression programs of histologically distinct stages of prostate carcinogenesis in Nkx3.1; Pten mutant mice Key histological and growth progression characteristics of human prostate cancer are phenocopied in mouse models that have been subjected to androgen level depletion and engineered for hemizygosity of candidate prostate cancer tumor suppressor genes Nkx3.1 and Pten.     To characterize their relative transcriptomes and identify a genomic basis for their relevance to human prostate cancers, we compared mouse prostate tumors expression profiles to those from a panel of human prostate cancer isolates and to normal and benign prostates.     Human prostate cancers and mouse prostate tumor models both exhibit the activation of genes associated with growth, cell cycle control, and inhibition of differentiation (CDKN2A, CDKN2B, CDKN2C, CEBPB, CEBPG, CSF1, CTSS, DMBT1, EGFR, PLCG2, PXN, SPP1, TNFSF9), and conversely, diminished expression of genes associated with normal prostate differentiation and function.     All tumors also exhibit dysregulated expression of genes associated with inflammation, the disruption of prostate-associated ER stress pathways, as well as with oxidative stress, energy metabolism, cell adhesion, and stress response.     Immunoinflammatory and altered cell adhesion process-associated genes exhibited prominent expression in early stage tumors.     In contrast, metastatic human prostate cancer samples eliminated the expression of most immunoinflammatory-associated transcripts.     Cross-species comparisons of molecular programs that are shared or distinguishing of Nkx3.1; Pten mutant mouse models and human adenocarcinomas clearly delineate core tumorigenesis programs associated with cell cycle activation and loss of differentiation.     Compared to locally spreading mouse and human tumors, metastatic prostate cancer exhibits greatly reduced expression of immunoinflammatory and adhesion genes, implying that immuno-inflammatory activation may enable first stages of tumorogenesis, but suppress metastasis.     These results provide a novel framework to identify stage-specific biomarkers and candidate targets for combinatorial therapeutics.     The complex role of inflammation suggests a need for additional caution in countering metastasis.      Keywords: tumor stage 26 Affymetrix MOE430A microarrays
 E-GEOD-14612 - Expression data from RAW 264.7 macrophage IFNg is a pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic cytokine that leads to macrophage activation.     Adenosine has well-documented anti-inflammatory properties.     We used microarrays to compare the global gene expression profile in mouse macrophages stimulated with IFNg alone and those cells treated with IFNg and adenosine.     We determined that adenosine suppressed the expression of many IFNg-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and other pro-atherogenic genes.      Keywords: treatment response RAW 264.7 cells were treated for 4 hours with either IFNg or IFNg plus adenosine.     Following treatment, total RNA was extracted and treatment groups were pooled from 2 separate experiments for hybridization of Affymetrix microarrays.
 E-GEOD-28737 - Conditional deletion of Bcl6 in naive B cells Bcl6 germline deletion causes a prominent inflammatory disease, owing to over-expression of Th2 cytokines, and affects the properties of B cells prior to immunization.     Therefore we established the B cell-specific Bcl6 deletion mice and analyze the gene expression of naive B cells under physiological conditions.     Total RNAs of splenic follicular and marginal zone B cells from Bcl6(flox/flox), Bcl6(+/flox) or Bcl6(+/+) mice heterozygous for mb1-cre were extracted and analysed on Affymetrix microarrays.
 E-GEOD-66104 - Transcriptomes of mesonephros- vs. ovary-derivd Gli1+ cells This goal of this microarray analysis is to determine whether the mesonephros-derived theca cells exhibt a different gene expression profile from that of the whole theca cell population The mesonephros-derived (n=3, Tamoxifen at E12.5, E14.5 and E16.5) and the neonatal ovary-derived Gli1-positive cells (n=3 Tamoxifen at P1-3 via lactating dams), were isolated from the adult ovaries of Gli1-CreERT2; Rosa-LSL-tdTomato mice at 2 months of age and were sorted by FACS
 E-GEOD-5510 - Transcription profiling of mouse wild type and Taf7l mutant testes TFIID is a general transcription factor required for transcription of most protein-coding genes by RNA polymerase II. TAF7L is an X-linked germ cell-specific paralogue of TAF7, which is a generally expressed component of TFIID. Here we report the generation of Taf7l mutant mice by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells using the Cre-loxP strategy.     While spermatogenesis is completed in Taf7l mutant mice, the weight of Taf7l mutant testis is decreased and the amount of sperm in the epididymis is sharply reduced.     Mutant epididymal sperm exhibit abnormal morphology including folded tails.     Sperm motility is significantly reduced, and Taf7l mutant males are fertile with reduced litter size.     Microarray profiling reveals that the abundance of six gene transcripts (including Fscn1) in Taf7l mutant testis decreases by   2-fold.     In particular, FSCN1 is an F-action-bundling protein and thus may be critical for normal sperm morphology and sperm motility.     Although deficiency of Taf7l may be compensated in part by Taf7, Taf7l has apparently evolved new specialized functions in the gene-selective transcription in male germ-cell differentiation.     Our mouse studies suggest that mutations in human TAF7L gene might be implicated in X-linked oligozoospermia in men.     Experiment Overall Design: Mice on C57BL/6J strain background were selected.     Testes from Taf7l mutant and wild type littermates at 8-weeks old were dissected.
 E-GEOD-76428 - Gene expression data from adipocytes of insulin resistant mice We developed a novel network inference approach, Biologically Anchored Knowledge Expansion (BAKE), to analyze large volume gene expression data obtained from a mouse model of insulin resistance progression.     Both genetic aspects and dietary factors, specifically high caloric high-fat high-sugar diets, contribute to the progression of insulin resistance.     To mimic genetic predisposition, we used a mouse model with double heterozygous deletion of early insulin signaling pathway intermediates, insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) genes.     These mice were fed with high-fat (Western) or low-fat (Chow) diet for 8 and 16 weeks starting at 8 weeks of age.     Gene expression data was collected from adipocytes isolated from these mice.     Applying BAKE analysis to the adipocyte gene expression data, we demonstrate that we can accurately discover a novel regulatory gene in the insulin signaling pathway.     The mouse model of double heterozygous deletion of insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) was originally introduced as a polygenic model to study the development of type 2 diabetes.     This mouse model, on an atherosclerosis-prone ApoE null background (IR+/- IRS1+/- ApoE-/-), also shows increased atherosclerotic lesions due to impaired insulin signaling.      For our study we used female double heterozygous mice (IR+/- IRS1+/-, 'Dhet' mice or 'D’ mice) on an ApoE null background (ApoE-/-, ‘E’) fed with a Western (high-fat) diet for 8 (DW8, n=5) and 16 (DW16, n=9) weeks starting at 8 weeks of age or with a Chow (low-fat) diet (DC8, n=7; DC16, n=5). There were also ApoE null mice (ApoE-/-, 'E’) fed either Western diet for 8 (EW8, n=6) and 16 (EW16, n=8) weeks or Chow diet for 16 weeks (EC16, n=5) starting at 8 weeks of age.
 E-GEOD-21224 - Transcriptional ontogeny of the developing liver We characterized gene expression changes in the developing mouse liver at gestational days (GD) 11.5, 12.5, 13.5, 14.5, 16.5, and 19.5 and in the neonate (postnatal day (PND) 7 and 30) using full-genome microarrays and compared these changes to that in the adult liver.     The fetal liver, and to a lesser extent the neonatal liver, exhibited dramatic differences in gene expression compared to adults.     Canonical pathway analysis of the fetal liver signature demonstrated increases in functions important in cell replication and DNA fidelity whereas most metabolic pathways of intermediary metabolism were suppressed.     Comparison of the dataset to a number of previously published datasets revealed 1) a striking similarity between the fetal liver and that of the pancreas in both mice and humans, 2) a nucleated erythrocyte signature in the fetus and 3) suppression of most xenobiotic metabolism genes throughout development, except a number of transporters associated with expression in hematopoietic cells.      Keywords: gene expression/microarray We characterized gene expression changes in the developing mouse liver at gestational days (GD) 19 and in the neonate (postnatal day (PND) 7 and 30) using full-genome microarrays and compared these changes to that in the adult liver.     Total RNA was isolated from liver samples and gene expression analyzed using Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 GeneChips.     Data from 16 samples, with four mice in each of the four age groups, were analyzed.

 E-GEOD-38988 - Cell Intrinsic role of Cox-2 in pancreatic cancer development Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is upregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC). However, how COX-2 promotes PDAC development is unclear.     While previous studies have evaluated the efficacy of COX-2 inhibition via the use of non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib in PDAC models, none have addressed the cell intrinsic vs. microenvironment roles of COX-2 in modulating PDAC initiation and progression.      We tested the cell intrinsic role of COX-2 in PDAC progression, using both loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches.      Cox-2 deletion in Pdx1+ pancreatic progenitor cells significantly delays the development of PDAC in mice with K-ras activation and Pten haploinsufficiency.      Conversely, COX-2 over-expression promotes early onset and progression of PDAC in the K-ras mouse model.      Loss of PTEN function is a critical factor in determining lethal PDAC onset and overall survival.      Mechanistically, COX-2 over-expression increases P-AKT levels in the precursor lesions of Pdx1+;K-rasG12D/+;Ptenlox/+ mice in the absence of Pten LOH. In contrast, Cox-2 deletion in the same setting diminishes P-AKT levels and delays cancer progression.      These data suggest an important cell intrinsic role for COX-2 in tumor initiation and progression through activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway.      PDAC that is independent of intrinsic COX-2 expression eventually develops with decreased FKBP5 and increased GRP78 expression, two alternate pathways leading to AKT activation.      Together, these results support a cell intrinsic role for COX-2 in PDAC development and suggest that, while anti-COX-2 therapy may delay the development and progression of PDAC, mechanisms known to increase chemoresistance through AKT activation must also be overcome.     Murine mutants with pancreatic specific loss of Pten (Pten +/-) and K-ras activation (K-rasG12D) and either COX-2 over-expression (Cox-2 COE) or knockout (Cox-2 KO) under regulation of the Pdx-1 promoter developed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.      RNA was extracted from pancreatic tumors from individual mutants with pathology thought to closely mimic the human disease.      Pancreatic tissue was subject to RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix cDNA microarrays.
 E-GEOD-5811 - Transcription profiling of mouse models of sepsis cecal ligation and puncture and tracheal instillation of P. aeruginosa reveals bcl-2 overexpression modulates transcription responses in vivo Background: We hypothesized that spleen microarray gene expression profiles analyzed with contemporary pathway analysis software would provide molecular pathways of interest and target genes that might help explain the affect of bcl-2 on improving survival during sepsis.     Methods: Two mouse models of sepsis, cecal ligation and puncture and tracheal instillation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were tested in both wild-type mice and mice that overexpress bcl-2.  Whole spleens were obtained 6 hours after septic injury.      DNA microarray transcriptional profiles were obtained using the Affymetrix 430A GeneChip, containing 22,690 elements.      Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software was used to construct hypothetical transcriptional networks that changed in response to sepsis and expression of the bcl-2 transgene.     Results:  A conservative approach was used wherein only changes induced by both abdominal and pulmonary sepsis were studied.      At 6 hours, sepsis induced alterations in the abundance of hundreds of spleen genes, including a number of proinflammatory mediators (e.g., IL-6).  These sepsis-induced alterations were blocked by expression of the bcl-2 transgene.      Network analysis implicated a number of bcl-2-related apoptosis genes, including bcl2L11 (bim), bcl-2L2 (bcl-w), bmf, and mcl-1.  Sepsis in bcl-2 transgenic animals resulted in alteration of RNA abundance for only a single gene, ceacam1. Conclusion:  These findings are consistent with sepsis-induced alterations in the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic transcriptional networks.      In addition, our data suggest that the ability of bcl-2 overexpression to improve survival in sepsis in this model is related in part to prevention of sepsis-induced alterations in spleen transcriptional responses.     Experiment Overall Design: To determine the splenic response in these lethal models of CLP and Pseudomonas pneumonia, microarray analysis was performed on each spleen harvested from wild-type animals 6 hours after CLP or tracheal instillation of bacteria.      The responses of the CLP or Pseudomonas spleens were compared concurrently to those of the wild-type controls, sham laparotomy and tracheal instillation of saline, respectively.      This study was repeated in animals overexpressing bcl-2.  Thus, the splenocyte effect of sepsis secondary to CLP (n=6) or Pseudomonas pneumonia (n=5) could be determined compared to their controls (n=6 and 5, respectively), and the effect of bcl-2 overexpression in turn also could be determined in both CLP (n=5) and pneumonia models (n=5) compared to controls (n=5 and 5, respectively).
 E-GEOD-4479 - Transcription profiling of mouse splenic CD4+ cells after surgical induction of sepsis vs. controls reveals a distinct transcriptional response 6 hours after sepsis induction Lymphocytes are adversely affected during sepsis.     Some CD4+ splenocytes undergo apoptosis while others become Th2 polarized.     The molecular determinants of these phenotypic changes are not known.     Here we compare the transcriptional response of septic CD4 splenocytes to CD4 splenocytes from sham-manipulated animals 6h after sepsis and identify an early transcriptional component to the septic CD4+ splenocyte phenotype.     CD4+ splenocytes were isolated 6h after the surgical induction of sepsis for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.     We sought to obtain a homogeneous cell population in order to reduce any effects of cellular heterogeneity on expression profiles.     To that end, immunomagnetic negative selection was used to enrich CD4+ splenocyte populations to ~91%. (n=5 biological replicates each CLP and sham)
 E-GEOD-12997 - Comparative transcriptomic analysis of BA- or BL- associated murine colonic epithelium A huge number of microorganisms are colonized in human gut and the balance of their composition is closely related to human health.     Recently, many probiotics such as bifidobacteria or lactobacilli have been introduced in our life as effective agents.     However, we have not well understood their beneficial mechanisms including host-bacterial crosstalk To analyze the differences of gene expression between BA- or BL-associated murine colonic epithelium, we performed comparative transcriptomic analysis.       Bifidobacterium adolescentis (BA)-associated mice and Bifidobacterium longum (BL)-associated mice were used.     Colonic epithelium was isolated and gene expression profile was analyzed.     Each 3 samples were analyzed.
 E-GEOD-10175 - Transcription profiling of mouse epidermis of Tcfap2c mutant and control skin at embryonic day 16.5 The development of the epidermis, a stratified squamous epithelium, is dependent on the regulated differentiation of keratinocytes.     Differentiation begins with the initiation of stratification, a process tightly controlled through proper gene expression.     AP-2γ is expressed in skin and previous research suggested a pathway where p63 gene induction results in increased expression of AP-2γ which in turn is responsible for induction of K14. This study uses a conditional gene ablation model to further explore the role of AP-2γ in skin development.      Mice deficient for AP-2γ exhibited delayed expression of p63, K14, and K1, key genes required for development and differentiation of the epidermis.     In addition, microarray analysis of E16.5 skin revealed delayed expression of additional late epidermal differentiation genes: filaggrin, repetin and secreted Ly6/Plaur domain containing 1, in mutant mice.     The genetic delay in skin development was further confirmed by a functional delay in the formation of an epidermal barrier.     These results document an important role for AP-2γ in skin development, and reveal the existence of regulatory factors that can compensate for AP-2γ in its absence.     Experiment Overall Design: Skin samples were collected from 3 Tcfap2c and 3 control animals at embryonic day 16.5.
 E-GEOD-16644 - Transcript abundance comparison between uninfected DCs and DCs housing L. amazonensis To determine the modulation of gene expression of mouse BMDCs in the presence of living intracellular Leishmania amazonensis amastigotes Dendritic cells were generated in vitro from bone marrow progenitors.     Leishmania amazonensis amastigotes were purified from mouse cutaneous lesions and were added to DC cultures.     After 24h, and following a sorting procedure, only BMDCs housing living amastigotes were selected for total RNA extraction.
 E-GEOD-11867 - Expression Profiling of Dll1 mutant mouse lines on different genetic background The evolutionarily conserved Delta-Notch cell-cell signal-transduction pathway regulates the determination of various cell fates, which are important for the morphogenesis and development of numerous organs and tissues in many vertebrates and invertebrates.      The Dll1 gene was mutated by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells such that amino acids 2-116 were replaced with an in-frame fusion of the lacZ gene of E.coli.     Mouse Dll1 genomic clones were isolated from a strain 129/SvPas library.     The replacement vector was constructed by inserting a 4 kb ClaI/XhoI fragment, which encodes a part of the beta-galactosidase gene followed by the PGK-neo cassette, and a 2.6 kb XhoI/EcoRI fragment as the 3’ homologous region of the replacement vector into pKS+. This vector was linearized with SalI and ClaI, and a 4.1 kb SalI/NcoI as the 5’ homologous region plus an NcoI/ClaI fragment (800 bp) completing the b-galactosidase gene, were inserted, resulting in the complete replacement vector.     This vector was linearized with SalI and electroporated in R1 embryonic stem cells.     Correctly targeted clones were identified and verified by Southern blot analysis using external probes from the 3’ and 5’ region of the targeted area, and were injected into C57BL/6J embryo to obtain germline transmission.      The two analysed Dll1 mutant mouse lines carry the same mutation but are on different genetic background: 1. Heterozygous F1-animals were backcrossed several times to the 129SV/J wild type; 2. Heterozygous F1-animals were outcrossed 11 generation to C3HeB/FeJ wild type Four organs (liver, spleen, thymus, brain) of two Dll1 mutant mouse lines on different genetic background carrying the same mutation were analysed by cDNA microarray technology.     Experiment include 4-5 biological replicates for reference (wildtype) and mutant animals.     Up to 4 technical replicates for each mutant mouse were performed.     As reference pooled RNA was used.     50% of the chip hybridisations are dye sway experiments.
 E-GEOD-10870 - Role of SRF in activity-regulated  transcription in the striatum of the brain Ablation of the Srf  gene in dopaminoceptive neurons of the brain was performed using the Cre/loxP system, with the recombinase expressed from a BAC-derived Drd1a promoter.     Our goal was to analyze how loss of SRF will affect acitivity-regulated transcription induced by strong stimulation, i.e. cocaine.     Keywords: Treatment x Genotype Animals were injected i.p. with either 25 mg/kg cocaine or saline and sacrificed after one hour by cervical dislocation.     Expression profiling was performed using total RNA isolated from the striatum.
 E-GEOD-4765 - Transcription profiling of mouse liver from inbred stains SM/J and NZB/BinJSM 3 x 3 comparison of the inbred strains SM/J and NZB/BinJ. Experiment Overall Design: Simple comparison of native untreated gene expression profiles of female 8wk old SM mice (x3) by female 8wk old NZB mice (x3)
 E-GEOD-29848 - Microarray data of differentiating embryonic stem cells overexpressing the transcription factor Msgn1 During mammalian gastrulation, pluripotent epiblast stem cells migrate through the primitive streak to form the multipotent progenitors of the mesoderm and endoderm germ layers.     Msgn1 is a bHLH transcription factor and is a direct target gene of the Wnt/bcatenin signaling pathway.     Msgn1 is expressed in the mesodermal compartment of the primitive streak and is necessary for the proper development of the mesoderm.     Msgn1 mutants show defects in somitogenesis leading to a lack of trunk skeletal muscles, vertebra and ribs.     To study the molecular and cellular function of Msgn1 in Embryonic Stem Cells (ESC), we have generated doxycycline inducible gain-of-function ESC to overexpress Msgn1 in ESC. In order to identify Msgn1 targets, we performed transcriptional profiling of Msgn1 expressing ES cells and found that upon induction of Msgn1, multiple genes in the Notch pathway were differentially expressed compared to the uninduced cells.     Moreover, Whole Mount Insitu Hybridization analysis in Msgn1 null mutants revealed that these Notch pathway genes required Msgn1 for their proper expression in vivo.     Our studies demonstrate that Msgn1 is a critical effector of the Wnt pathway during mammalian somitogenesis, mediating crosstalk between the Wnt and Notch pathways.     Inducible A2lox-Flag Msgn1 ES cells were differentiated to form Embryoid bodies (EBs) for 2 days.     Flag-Msgn1 was induced on day 2 with doxycycline and samples were collected at three time points, 12h, 24h and 48h after addition of doxycycline.     Uninduced cells were used as controls.     Experiments were performed in triplicate
 E-GEOD-12748 - Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis Identifies Biomarkers in Glycerol Kinase Deficient Mice Symptomatic glycerol kinase deficiency (GKD) is associated with episodic metabolic and central nervous system deterioration.      We report here the first application of Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to investigate a knockout (KO) murine model of a human genetic disease.      WGCNA identified networks and key hub transcripts from liver mRNA of glycerol kinase (Gyk) KO and wild type (WT) mice.          Day of life 1 (dol1) samples from KO mice contained a network module enriched for organic acid metabolism before Gyk KO mice develop organic acidemia and die on dol3-4 and the module containing Gyk was enriched with apoptotic genes.      Roles for the highly connected Acot, Psat and Plk3 transcripts were confirmed in cell cultures and subsequently validated by causality testing.      We provide evidence that GK may have an apoptotic moonlighting role that is lost in GKD.    This systems biology strategy has improved our understanding of GKD pathogenesis and suggests possible treatments.     Male WT and KO mouse pups were sacrificed on day of life (dol) 1 and each liver was harvested.      Total RNA from 4 KO and 3 WT livers was isolated individually.      Affymetrix mus 430 2.0 GeneChips were used to analyze differences in liver gene expression between KO and WT mice.      Dol1 and 3 Gyk KO mice represent different disease states.      Dol 1 was chosen because mice are phenotypically asymptomatic with respect to Glycerol Kinase Deficiency (GKD) and allowed us to look at alterations that occur before the overt disease state.      Dol 3 mice are phenotypically symptomatic with respect to GKD.
 E-GEOD-38822 - Gene expression profiling of experimental granulation tissue in Mmp13-/- mice compared to wild type mice Proteinases play a pivotal role in wound healing by degrading molecular barriers, regulating cell-matrix interactions and availability of bioactive molecules.     Matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13, collagenase-3) is a wide spectrum proteinase.     Its expression and function is linked to the growth and invasion of many epithelial cancers such as squamous cell carcinoma.     Moreover, the physiologic expression of MMP-13 is associated e.g. to scarless healing of human fetal skin and adult gingival wounds.     While MMP-13 is not found in the normally healing skin wounds in human adults, it is expressed in mouse skin during wound healing.     Thus, mouse wound healing models can be utilized for studying the role of MMP-13 in the events of wound healing.     As the processes such as the migration and proliferation of keratinocytes, angiogenesis, inflammation and activation of fibroblasts are components of wound repair as well as of cancer, many results received from wound healing studies are also adaptable to cancer research.     Classically, the process of wound healing can be devided into three phases which are histologically and functionally separate but temporally overlapping: 1) hemostasis and inflammation, 2) re-epithelialization and granulation tissue formation, and 3) matrix remodeling.     Granulation tissue is formed into the wound via fibroplasia, angiogenesis and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition by fibroblasts.     Granulation tissue is rich in inflammatory cells, fibroblasts, myofibroblasts and blood vessels.     After epidermal recovery, the granulation tissue is resolved via matrix remodeling and cell apoptosis.     A sterile viscose cellulose sponge (VCS) characterized by defined size and structure can be used to experimentally induce formation of subcutaneous granulation tissue.     Compared to normal granulation tissue, this model allows easy examination of the granulation tissue in its entirety but leaving out epidermal keratinocytes in the sample preparation.     In this study, we studied the role of MMP-13 in the formation of mouse VCS-induced granulation tissue.     We performed gene expression profiling of the granulation tissue samples of Mmp13-/- (KO) and wild type (WT) mice harvested at day 7, day 14 and day 21 after VCS implantation.     Mmp13-/- (KO) mice were generated as described (Inada et al.  2004, PNAS, 101: 17192-17197) and used in these experiments after backcrossing at least seven generations into C57BL6 mice.     The WT mice were generated from the backcrossed heterozygote Mmp13-/- (KO) mice.     Granulation tissues were harvested at three time points (7d, 14d, 21d) from Mmp13-/- (KO) and WT mice.     One sample of each mouse was analyzed (n=3, 7d; n=4, 14d; n=4, 21d; for each genotype). The samples were processed for RNA extraction and Affymetrix 3'IVT DNA microarray gene expression analysis.
 E-GEOD-31792 - Distinct and Overlapping Gene Regulatory Networks in BMP- and HDAC-Controlled Cell Fate Determination in the Embryonic Forebrain Both bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) have previously been established to play a role in the development of the three major cell types of the central nervous system: neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes.     We have previously established a connection between these two protein families, showing that HDACs suppress BMP-promoted astrogliogenesis in the embryonic striatum.     Since HDACs act in the nucleus to effect changes in transcription, an unbiased analysis of their transcriptional targets could shed light on their downstream effects on BMP-signaling.     Using neurospheres from the embryonic striatum as an in vitro system to analyze this phenomenon, we have performed microarray expression profiling on BMP2- and trichostatin A (TSA)-treated cultures, followed by validation of the findings with quantitative RT-PCR and protein analysis.     Neurospheres from the embryonic striatum were used to analyze cellular differentiation into neurons and astrocytes in vitro.     To analyze the role of BMP2 and the HDAC-inhibitor TSA in this system, neurospheres were treated with TSA or BMP2 for 24 h, and mRNA was extracted after 6 and 24 h of the respective treatment.
 E-GEOD-22417 - Gene expression profile associated with the PDZ ligand-motif of HPV16-E6 oncoprotin in the skin of transgenic mice models The K14E6 transgenic mice developskin hyperplasia,benign tumors and skin cancer.     The tumor formation capacity diminishes when E6 lacks its PDZ ligand-motif.     This study aims to compare the transciptional profiles of transgenic K14E6 mice with K14E6 Δ146-151 (lacking the PDZ domain) in order to explore the role of PDZ in early skin carcinogenesis.     Skin tissue from three different strains of mice were dissected for RNA extraction, processing and hybridization in Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2,0 array.     We processed three biological replicates per strain.     3 mice were used for each replicate pool for a final RNA concentration of 3 micrograms.     The arrays were analyzed using Partek Genomics suite software.
 E-GEOD-65667 - Effect of maple syrup extract on the liver of mice fed a high-fat diet The effects of the administration of maple syrup extract (MSX) on hepatic gene expression were investigated in mice fed high-fat diet.     Male C57BL/6J mice aged 3 weeks were purchased from Charles River Japan (Kanagawa, Japan) and housed in a room maintained at 23 ± 1°C and 49 ± 16% humidity with a 12-h light/dark cycle (light 08:00–20:00; dark 20:00–08:00).  For 1 week acclimation period after purchase, all the mice were fed a low-fat diet (10 kcal% fat).  Then, they were randomly divided into three different dietary groups: the first group with the food containing fat at 10 kcal% as low-fat diet, the second group with 45 kcal% as high-fat diet, and the third with HFD plus 0.06% MSX.  The mice were fed ad libitum for 8 weeks.
 E-GEOD-12501 - Transcription profiling of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) trisomic for chromosomes 1, 13, 16 and 19 Aneuploidy, an incorrect chromosome number, is the leading cause of miscarriages and mental retardation in humans and is a hallmark of cancer.     We examined the effects of aneuploidy on primary mouse cells by generating a series of cell lines that carry an extra copy of one of four mouse chromosomes.     In all four trisomic lines proliferation was impaired and metabolic properties were altered.     Immortalization, the acquisition of the ability to proliferate indefinitely, was also affected by the presence of an additional chromosome, with some chromosomes inhibiting immortalization while others accelerating the process.     Our data indicate that aneuploidy decreases not only organismal but also cellular fitness and elicits traits that are shared between different aneuploid cells.     Experiment Overall Design: The mRNAs from 9 different mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) lines with a normal complement of chromosomes were compared to mRNAs from 1 MEF line with three copies of chromosome 1, 4 MEF lines with three copies of chrmosome 13, 3 MEF lines with three copies of chromosome 16 and 1 MEF line with three copies of chromosome 19.
 E-GEOD-29748 - C57BL/6N Mice on High Fat Diet Display Reduced Intestinal and Hepatic Cholesterol Levels despite a Plasma Hypercholesterolemia Background Small intestine and liver greatly contribute to whole body lipid, cholesterol and phospholipid metabolism but to which extent cholesterol and phospholipid handling in these tissues is affected by high fat Western-style obesogenic diets remains to be defined.     We therefore quantified cholesterol and phospholipid concentrations in intestine and liver and determined fecal neutral sterol and bile acid excretion in C57Bl/6N mice fed for 12 weeks either a cholesterol-free high carbohydrate control diet or a high fat diet containing 0.03 % (w/w) cholesterol.     To identify underlying mechanisms of dietary adaptation in intestine and liver, changes in gene expression were assessed by microarray and qPCR profiling, respectively.      Results Animals on high fat diet showed increased plasma cholesterol levels, associated with the higher dietary cholesterol supply, yet, significantly reduced cholesterol levels were found in intestine and liver.     Transcript profiling revealed evidence that expression of numerous genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and uptake via LDL, but also in phospholipid metabolism, underwent compensatory regulations in both tissues.     Alterations in glycerophospholipid metabolism were confirmed at the metabolite level by phospolipid profiling via mass spectrometry.      Conclusions Our findings suggest that intestine and liver react to a high dietary fat intake by an activation of de novo cholesterol synthesis and other cholesterol-saving mechanisms, as well as with major changes in phospholipid metabolism, to accommodate to the fat load.     The proximal part of the intestine of mice fed either a control or a high fat diet were analyzed.     5 replicates each.
 E-GEOD-10347 - Transcription profiling of mouse Hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase knockout muscle at 4 weeks Hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PD)is the initial component of a pentose phosphate pathway inside the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that generates NADPH for ER enzymes.     In liver, H6PD is required for the 11-oxoreductase activity of 11ss-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11ss-HSD1), which converts inactive 11-oxo glucocorticoids to their active 11-hydroxyl counterparts; consequently, H6PD null mice are relatively insensitive to glucocorticoids, exhibiting fasting hypoglycemia, increased insulin sensitivity despite elevated circulating levels of corticosterone, and increased basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscles normally enriched in Type II (fast) fibers which have increased glycogen content.     They also display a progressive vacuolar myopathy evident after 4 weeks of age.     We carried out microarray analysis on TA and soleus muscles from 4 week old WT and KO mice to determine an expression profile predicting myopathy.     Experiment Overall Design: 4 week old mice are weaned and do not display overt histological evidence of myopathy.     Soleus and tibialis anterior are used as comparison groups as they have distinct fibre type content and differing metabolic properties.     3 biological replicates are used for each genotpye and sample type.
 E-GEOD-11112 - Foxf1 enchances pulmonary inflammation and mastocytosis The Forkhead Box f1 (Foxf1) transcriptional factor (previously known as HFH-8 or Freac-1) is expressed in endothelial and smooth muscle cells in the embryonic and adult lung.     To assess effects of Foxf1 during lung injury, we used CCl4 injury model.      Foxf1+/- mice developed severe airway obstruction and bronchial edema, associated with increased numbers of pulmonary mast cells and increased mast cell degranulation following injury.      Pulmonary inflammation in Foxf1+/- mice was associated with diminished expression of Foxf1, increased mast cell tryptase and increased expression of CXCL12, the latter being essential for mast cell migration and chemotaxis.      Foxf1 haploinsufficiency caused pulmonary mastocytosis and enhanced pulmonary inflammation following chemically-induced lung injury, indicating an important role for Foxf1 in the pathogenesis of pulmonary inflammatory responses.     Keywords: Influence of genetic modification on the pulmonary inflamation Foxf1+/- mice in which the Foxf1 allele was disrupted by an in-frame insertion of a nuclear localizing -galactosidase (-Gal) gene were bred for ten generations into the Black Swiss mouse genetic background.     Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4; Sigma, St Louis, MO) was dissolved in mineral oil at a 1:20 ratio v/v and a single intraperitoneal  (i.p.) injection of CCl4 (0.5 l of CCl4/ 1g of body weight) was administered to male Foxf1+/- mice or their wild type (WT) littermates as described.
 E-GEOD-51632 - Effect of enforced BMP4 expression on gene expression profile of 4T1.2 whole primary murine mammary tumours BMP4 is down-regulated in metastatic human and murine mammary tumours.     Here we determined the effect of ectopic mouse Bmp4 re-expression on global gene expression patterns in orthotopic primary mammary tumours in syngeneic Balb/c mice.     Breast cancer is a major cause of cancer related death in women, due to the development of metastatic disease in vital organs.     Metastasis can be facilitated by tumor induced MDSC, which requires understanding.     We have confirmed that BMP4 is a potent suppressor of breast cancer metastasis, but for potential clinical application, it is important to understand how BMP4 acts to suppress metastasis.     Here, we report one mechanism by which BMP4 can inhibit metastasis.     Mice bearing highly metastatic mammary tumors present with elevated numbers of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC), the extent of which is markedly reduced upon exogenous BMP4 expression.     Increased numbers of MDSC can also be induced directly by treatment with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), leading to enhancement of metastasis.     Both tumor-induced and G-CSF-induced MDSC can effectively suppress T cell activation and proliferation.     BMP4 acts to reduce the expression and secretion of G-CSF through inhibition of NFkB activity in several human and mouse tumor lines.     Since MDSC in breast cancer patients are correlated with poor prognosis, BMP4 treatment offers a potential new therapeutic strategy for progressive breast disease.     Three 4T1.2 primary mammary tumours and three 4T1.2-Bmp4 primary mammary tumours were analyzed.
 E-GEOD-43261 - Fluoxetine resistance in mice is associated with attenuated progression of a stereotyped dentate gyrus gene expression program Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine are the most common treatment for major depression.     However, approximately 50% of depressed patients fail to achieve an effective treatment response.     Understanding how gene expression systems relate to treatment responses may be critical for understanding antidepressant resistance.     Transcriptome profiling allows for the simultaneous measurement of expression levels for thousands of genes and the opportunity to utilize this information to determine mechanisms underlying antidepressant treatment responses.     However, the best way to relate this immense amount of information to treatment resistance remains unclear.     We take a novel approach to this question by examining dentate gyrus transcriptomes from the perspective of a stereotyped fluoxetine-induced gene expression program.     Expression programs usually represent stereotyped changes in expression levels that occur as cells transition phenotypes.     Fluoxetine will shift transcriptomes so they lie somewhere between a baseline state and a full-response at the end of the program.     The position along this fluoxetine-induced gene expression program (program status) was measured using principal components analysis (PCA). The same expression program was initiated in treatment-responsive and resistant mice but treatment response was associated with further progression along the fluoxetine-induced gene expression program.     The study of treatment-related differences in gene expression program status represents a novel way to conceptualize differences in treatment responses at a transcriptome level.     Understanding how antidepressant-induced gene expression program progression is modulated represents an important area for future research and could guide efforts to develop novel augmentation strategies for antidepressant treatment resistant individuals.     38 samples, 2 dentate regions (dorsal/ventral), 3 groups (control, antidepressant resistant (4 mice), antidepressant responsive (7 mice), untreated (8 mice).
 E-GEOD-47022 - Impaired Transcriptional Response of the Murine Heart To Cigarette Smoke in the Setting of High Fat Diet and Obesity To identify biosignatures that describe these lifestyle susceptibility factors, we performed parallel exposures of regular weight (RW) C57BL/6 and diet-induced obese (DIO) C57BL/6 mice to cigarette smoke, either mainstream (MS) or sidestream (SS), mimicking both the smoker and environmental exposure through second-hand smoke, respectively.     Transcriptional responses were measured by global microarray analysis of heart tissue.     Groups (N=6-8 biological replicates) of RW and DIO C57BL/6 mice (15-weeks old at start of exposures) were exposed to either filtered air (sham controls, SC), mainstream (MS) or sidestream (SS) cigarette smoke by nose-only inhalation exposure for 5 hr/day for a total of eight exposures over two weeks as follows: 5 consecutive days of exposure, followed by 2 days with no exposure, then three days of exposure, with necropsies occurring the day following the last exposure.
 E-GEOD-52022 - Genome wide analysis of transcriptome and microRNAs in early stage of Alzheimer’s disease (mRNA) We addressed the integrated analysis of mRNA and miRNA expression levels of Tg6799 AD model mice at 4 month and 8 months of age.     Total 8 gene cluster modules for co-expression network were predicted from transcriptome data and 6 modules were show relation  with AD or aging.     We constructed early stage AD network using data integration between mRNA and miRNA profiles and predicted miRNAs strongly involved in module regulation.     We found that ARRDC3 showed AD mutation dependent changes of expression and was related metabolic dysfunction in early stage AD. These results demonstrate that candidate genes on the simultaneous profiling of mRNA and miRNA expressions in genome wide can be used for the understanding of non-coding RNA related gene expression in early stage AD. We suggested that our results could be future candidate to be developed as early biomarkers in progressive AD pathology.      This result can be used for the further application in neurodegenerative diseases.     Tg6799 transgenic mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (USA) and were housed under a 12h light-dark cycle with free access to food and water.     Female Tg6799 mice are maintained until 4 months and 8 months of age (for littermate control: LM and mutant subjects: MT). RNA samples were isolated from hippocampus of mice using TRI-Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.     Gene expression was analyzed with GeneChip® Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), which is comprised of over 45,000 probe sets representing approximately 28,700 well-characterized mouse genes.     The  Ion Total RNA-Seq Kit v2 (Lifetechnologies, USA) was used for the preparation of micro RNA libraries according to the manufacturer's instructions.     Total numbers of subject used are as followed: 1) LM 4 months : MT 4 months : LM 8 months : MT 8 months (2:4:2:4) for screening mRMA and miRNA, 2) LM 4 months : MT 4 months : LM 8 months : MT 8 months (4:4:4:4) for expression verification.

 E-GEOD-11123 - Transcription profiling of mouse liver gene expression after a single acute 2h exposure to combined acoustic and restraint stress vs. control Stress is a powerful modulator of neuroendocrine, behavioral and immunological functions.     After 4.5 days of repeated combined acoustic and restraint stress as a murine model of chronic psychological stress severe metabolic dysregulations became detectable in female BALB/c mice.     Stress-induced alterations of metabolic processes that were found in a hepatic mRNA expression profiling were verified by in vivo analyses.     Repeatedly stressed mice developed a hypermetabolic syndrome with severe loss of lean body mass, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, increased amino acid turn-over, and acidosis.     This was associated with hypercortisolism, hyperleptinemia, insulin resistance, and hypothyroidism.     In contrast, after a single acute stress exposure changes in expression of metabolic genes were much less pronounced and predominantly confined to gluconeogenesis, probably indicating that metabolic disturbances might be initiated already early but will only manifest in repeatedly stressed mice .Thus, in our murine model, repeated stress caused severe metabolic dysregulations leading to a drastic reduction of the individual’s energy reserves.     Under such circumstances stress may further reduce the ability to cope with new stressors such as infection or cancer.     Endocrinology Epub ahead of print, March 11, 2008;  doi:10.1210/en.2008-0038 Experiment Overall Design: Two biological experiments of a single acute exposure to combined acoustic and restraint stress were performed, which consist each of an acutely stressed group and an untreated control group.     Liver RNA expression profiles were analyzed using pools of 8 or 9 individual RNAs of each group.
 E-GEOD-55746 - Transcriptional profiling of liver from wild type and PXR-null mice treated with PCN Many environmentally-relevant chemicals and drugs activate the nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR).  Activation of PXR can lead to increases in liver weight in part through hepatocyte replication similar to a large number of compounds that activate other nuclear receptors such as the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha and the constitutive activated receptor (CAR).  PXR controls the expression of a large battery of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism.      Identification of genes that are accurate predictors of PXR activation would be useful in high-throughput screens to assess potential toxicity and drug-drug interactions.      Here, we identified PXR-dependent genes in the mouse liver after exposure to pregnenolone 16alpha-carbinonitrile (PCN), a chemical that is often used as a model PXR agonist.      The animal studies were carried out at the University of Kansas Medical Center (Kansas City, KS) under federal guidelines for the use and care of laboratory animals and was approved by the KUMC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.      Eight-week-old adult C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME).  Generation of the PXR-null mice was previously described (Staudinger et al., (2001),  Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 98:3369–3374).  PXR-null breeder pairs were engineered and backcrossed into the C57BL/6 background.      Adult male wild-type mice and PXR-null mice were maintained on standard laboratory chow and were allowed food and water ad libitum.     All mice were treated once a day i.p. with either vehicle (corn oil) or PCN at 400 mg/kg/day for 4 days.      Livers were removed 24-hrs after the last dose.      Portions of the livers were rapidly snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C until analysis.      Liver gene expression analysis was performed according to the Affymetrix recommended protocol using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 GeneChips®. Total RNA (5 μg per sample) was labelled using the Affymetrix® One-Cycle cDNA Synthesis protocol and hybridized to arrays as described by the manufacturer (Affymetrix®, Santa Clara, CA).  Microarray hybridizations were conducted overnight at 45°C while rotating in an Affymetrix hybridization oven.     After 16 hours of hybridization, the cocktail was removed and the arrays were washed and stained in an Affymetrix GeneChip® fluidics station 450 according to the Affymetrix-recommended protocol.     Arrays were scanned on an Affymetrix GeneChip® scanner.     Four mice per group were examined.
 E-GEOD-65249 - Neural Stem/Progenitor Cell Properties of Glial Cells in the Adult Auditory Nerve [cultured auditory nerve cells] Spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) and the associated components of the auditory nerve are primary carriers of auditory information from hair cells to the brain.      Loss of SGNs occurs with many pathological conditions, resulting in permanent sensorineural hearing loss.      Neural stem/progenitors (NSPs) have been well-characterized in several locations of adult brain and retina.      However, it is unclear whether NSPs are present in the adult auditory nerve.      Here we examined the self-renewal potential of the adult auditory nerve using ouabain application as a well-established mouse model of acute SGN injury.      The observed increase in cell proliferation, alteration in enchromatin/heterochromatin ratio and down-regulation of histone deacetylase expression in glial cells suggest that the quiescent glial cells convert to an activated state after SGN degeneration.      This was further confirmed by global gene expression analysis of injured auditory nerves, which showed up-regulation of numerous neurogenesis- and/or development-associated genes shortly after ouabain exposure.      These genes include molecular markers commonly used for the identification of NSPs.  Under a strict culture regimen, auditory nerve-derived cells of adult mouse ears gave rise to neurospheres, suggesting that multipotent NSPs are present in adult cochlear nerve.      Neurosphere assays on Sox2 transgenic mice revealed that Sox2+ glial cells are the source for NSPs.  Our data also showed that acute injury or hypoxia enhances neurosphere formation.      Taken together, our study revealed that glial cells of adult cochlea exhibit several NSP characteristics, and hence these mature non-neuronal cells may be important targets for promoting self-repair of degenerative auditory nerves.     Auditory nerves were removed from the temporal bones of adult CBA/CaJ mice, aged 8 to 12 weeks.     Tissues were either collected and used directly as the tissue samples or dissociated and used for the cell culture samples.     Dissociated auditory nerve cells were propagated and grown to full confluency (5-7 days), constituting the cultured cell samples.     For neurosphere samples, growth medium was changed to neurosphere formation medium and the cells were cultured for an additional 12 days.     All samples were prepared in triplicate (n=3).
 E-GEOD-67389 - Expression data from murine subcutaneous and brown adipose tissue Two types of adipose tissues, white and brown, are found in mammals.     Increasingly novel strategies are being proposed for the treatment of obesity and its associated complications by altering amount and/or activity of BAT using mouse models.     We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in subcutaneous white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue.     White adipose tissue (Subcutaneous region) and brown adipose tissue (intrascapular) were isolated from LACA mice (male, 25 ± 3g ) for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
 E-GEOD-52624 - Leishmania major modulates autophagy in host macrophages during intracellular differentiation Autophagy generally participates in innate immunity by elimination of intracellular pathogens.     However, many of them developed successful strategies to counteract their autolysosomal digestion and lastly to exploit this catabolic cellular process.     Protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania are the causative agent of leishmaniasis, one of the 13 most important tropical diseases.     Leishmania persists as endo-parasite in host macrophages, where it uses multiple strategies to manipulate the microbicidal host cell functions and to escape from the host immune system.     Understanding how Leishmania interacts with host macrophages during uptake, differentiation, intracellular replication, and release might be the key to develop new drugs in target-directed approaches to treat patient with leishmaniasis.     Here, we generated expression profiles from bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) at 1h and 24h post infection (p.i.) with Leishmania major and respective controls.
 E-GEOD-29674 - Differential pancreatic islet global gene expression in young heterozygous Men1 mice and wildtype littermates Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Tumor Syndrome type 1 (MEN 1) is an autosomal dominant tumor syndrome affecting individuals with a heterozygous germline mutaion of the MEN1 gene.     MEN 1 carriers commonly develop parathyroid, anterior pituitary, duodenal and pancreatic endocrine tumors.     The phenotype of existing mouse models for the MEN 1 syndrome, with a germline heterozygous (hz) Men1 gene inactivation, show close resemblance to the human MEN 1 syndrome.     Menin, the protein encoded for by the MEN1/Men1 gene, lacks homology with known proteins, and evidence of its involvement in different cellular processes is steadily growing.     Several interaction partners have been identified, involving different interaction sites on the menin protein.     Accumulating evidence suggests a role for menin in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle control, apoptosis, chromatin modification and DNA damage response and repair.     Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the MEN1 gene precedes tumor formation in the MEN 1 heterozygous pancreas.     We set out to determine if there is a change in gene expression early on in the hz islet, as compared with islets in wildtype (wt) littermates, long before the LOH events occur.     We performed a global mRNA expression microarray on islets from young, five-week-old, hz Men1 mice and their wt littermates, and we have subsequently corroborated a subset of the findings on the qPCR and protein level.     Islets were isolated and RNA prepared from five five-week-old female mice heterozygous for the Men1 gene and five female wildtype littermates, and then a global gene expression microarray was performed.
 E-GEOD-6980 - Transcription profiling of mouse multiple myeloma tumors and splenic B cells from transgenics overexpressing XBP-1s Multiple myeloma (MM) evolves from highly prevalent premalignant condition termed Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS).  We report an MGUS-MM phenotype arising in transgenic mice with Emu-directed expression of the unfolded protein/ER stress response and plasma cell development spliced isoform factor XBP-1s.  Emu-XBP-1s elicited elevated serum Ig and IL-6 levels, skin alterations and with advancing age, a significant proportion of Emu-xbp-1s transgenic mice develop features diagnostic of human MM including bone lytic lesions.     Transcriptional profiles of Emu-xbp-1s B lymphoid and MM cells show aberrant expression of genes known to be dysregulated in human MM including Cyclin D1, MAF, MAFB, and APRIL. This genetic model coupled with documented frequent XBP-1s overexpression in human MM serve to implicate chronic XBP-1s dysregulation in the development of this common and lethal malignancy.       Experiment Overall Design: In this study, we have explored the biological impact of sustained XBP-1s expression in the lymphoid system, anticipating that this genetic event would be a necessary component along with other MM-relevant oncogenes and tumor suppressor gene manipulations to generate a MM-prone mouse model.      Unexpectedly, XBP-1s overexpression alone yielded an MGUS-MM disease bearing many features classical of the human disease on the clinical, pathological and molecular levels.     Experiment Overall Design: We performed expression analysis of B cells derived from the spleen of 20-week old Emu-xbp-1s mice (n=5) and non-transgenic mice (n=5). Additionally, we analyzed the expression profiles from MM tumor cells arising in Emu-xbp-1s mice (n=6).
 E-GEOD-71348 - Expression data of mESCs differentiated into Paraxial mesoderm Stem cell-derived tissues have wide potential for modelling developmental and pathological processes as well as cell-based therapy.     However, it has proven difficult to generate several key cell types in vitro, including skeletal muscle.     In vertebrates, skeletal muscles derive during embryogenesis from the presomitic mesoderm (PSM). Using PSM development as a guide, we establish conditions for the differentiation of monolayer cultures of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells into PSM-like cells without the introduction of transgenes or cell sorting.     We differentiated mouse ESCs in serum-free medium supplemented with Rspo3 ( or as an alternative with Chir 9902) and the Bmp inhibitor LDN193189. In vivo, the PSM cells are first expressing Msgn1 (posterior PSM marker) and then mature to express Pax3 (anterior PSM marker). After 4 days of differentiation of mESCs, Msgn1-positive cells were FACS-sorted and their transcriptome analyzed.     After 6 days of differentiation, Pax3-positive cells were sorted and their transcriptome analyzed.     Mouse ESCs differentiated for 0, 4 and 6 days in serum-free medium containing a Wnt activator, a BMP inhibitor and DMSO, to study paraxial mesoderm in vitro
 E-GEOD-9785 - Transcription profiling of newborn mice infected with Shigella flexneri In order to identify the developmental changes controlling the switch from disease susceptibility to resistance, we performed global gene expression analysis on non-infected and infected intestinal tissues taken from 4-day- and 7-day-old animals.     Experiment Overall Design: RNA from intestinal tissues of 4-day- or 7-day-old mice infected or not with invasive (INV+) or non-invasive (INV-) Shigella strains during 2 or 4 hours were hybridized on Murine MOE430A Affymetrix Genechip.
 E-GEOD-31359 - Expression data from mouse EMT-induced and non-induced cells The conversion of an epithelial cell to a mesenchymal cell is critical to vertebrate embryogenesis and a defining structural feature of organ development, such as forming fibroblasts in injured tissues, or in initiating metastases in epithelial cancer.     From a general perspective, EMT is about disaggregating epithelial units and reshaping epithelia for movement.       This phenotypic conversion requires the molecular reprogramming of epithelia with new biochemical instructions.     It is known that commonly used molecular markers for EMT include increased expression of N-cadherin and vimentin, nuclear localization of beta-catenin, and increased production of the transcription factors such as Snail, Twist, and SIP1/ZEB2. Much of this conversion, however, has been studied during experiments that expose new transduction and signaling pathways in epithelia, and more recently in fibrogenic tissues.     It is not yet clear whether the fibroblast transition of EMT is an expected middle phase of transdifferentiating epithelia, or whether EMT producing fibroblasts is an arrested form of transdifferentiation.       EMT is easily engaged by a combination of cytokines associated with proteolytic digestion of basement membranes upon which epithelia reside.     We analyzed PCA and hierarchical clustering method of the gene expression pattern of the renal tubular cells and mammary gland cells.     We then identified the genes which discriminate between the renal tubular and the mammary gland epithelial cells (PC1), or EMT-induced and non-induced cells (PC3). Undergoing EMT identifies the genes that discriminate between the renal tubular and the mammary gland epithelial cells(PC1), or EMT-induced and non-induced cells (PC3). Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array was used to transcriptionally profile to compare mouse EMT-induced cells and non-induced cells.
 E-GEOD-9355 - Transcription profiling of mouse mammary tumours developed in Wap-Cre;Etv6-NTRK3 mice We report a mouse model that recapitulates expression of the ETV6-NTRK3 (EN) fusion oncoprotein, the product of the t(12;15)(p13;q25) translocation characteristic of human secretory breast carcinoma.     Activation of EN expression in mammary tissues by Whey acidic protein (Wap) promoter-driven Cre leads to fully penetrant, multifocal malignant breast cancer with short latency.     We provide genetic evidence that committed bipotent or CD61+ luminal alveolar progenitors, are targets of tumorigenesis.     Furthermore, EN transforms these otherwise transient progenitors through activation of the AP1 complex.     Given increasing relevance of chromosomal translocations in epithelial cancers, such mice serve as a paradigm for the study of their genetic pathogenesis and cellular origins, and generation of novel preclinical models.     In this study, we generated microarray expression profiling data from both genetically marked, FACS-sorted tumor epithelial cells and from unfractionated mammary tumors and normal mammary glands.     By using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on these data, we have identified the AP1 transcriptional complex as the major downstream effector of the ETV6-NTRK3 signaling.     Experiment Overall Design: Take the advantage of the Cre-lox system and a floxed lacZ reporter at the Rosa26 locus (Rosa-Stop-lacZ), we genetically marked mammary epithelial cells in which the conditional Etv6-NTRK3 knockin allele were turned on, and followed them to the hyperplasia and tumor stages.     We then sorted lacZ+ hyperplastic mammary epithelial cells and lacZ+ tumor epithelial cells and collected their expression profiles by Affymetrix mouse whole genome MOE430.2 chips.     We also collected expression profiles from unfractionated mammary tumors (unsorted tumors) derived from the same mouse model and mammary glands from normal mice.
 E-GEOD-11426 - Transcription profiling of mouse anorexia-cachexia syndrome in anx/anx mouse model The anx/anx mouse displays poor appetite and lean appearance and is considered a good model for the study of anorexia nervosa.     To identify new genes involved in feeding behavior and body weight regulation we performed an expression profiling in the hypothalamus of the anx/anx mice.     Using commercial microarrays we detected 156 differentially expressed genes and validated 92 of those using TaqMan low-density arrays.     Our results showed an enrichment of deregulated genes involved in cell death, cell morphology and cancer as well as an alteration of several signaling circuits involved in energy balance including neuropeptide Y and melanocortin signaling.     The expression profile along with the phenotype let us to conclude that anx/anx mice resemble the anorexia-cachexia syndrome typically observed in cancer, infection with human immunodeficiency virus or chronic diseases rather than starvation, and that anx/anx mice could be considered a good model for the treatment and investigation of this condition.     Experiment Overall Design: Total RNA expression profile comparison between 3 pairs of anx/anx mice and wild type littermates in brain hypothalamus and neocortex
 E-MEXP-3013 - prolactin induced murine mammary carcinomas with different estrogen receptor status 8 independent mammary tumors (4 estrogen receptor alpha positive, 4 estrogen receptor negative by immunohistochemistry) that arose in nonparous NRL-PRL transgenic mice (FVB/N) were examined.
 E-MEXP-1325 - Transcription profiling by array of mouse B cells mutant for mir-155 after treatment with LPS and IL4 Wild type or miR-155 deficient b cells from 5 individuals each were stimulated with LPS and IL4 for 24hs and profiled.
 E-GEOD-35334 - The histone chaperone Spt6 is required for AID target determination through H3K4me3 regulation H3K4me3 plays a critical role in the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-induced DNA cleavage of switch (S) regions in the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus during class-switch recombination (CSR). The histone chaperone complex facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT) is responsible for forming H3K4me3 at AID target loci.     Histone chaperone suppressor of Ty6 (Spt6) also participates in regulating H3K4me3 for CSR and for somatic hypermutation (SHM) in AID target loci.     H3K4me3 loss was correlated with defects in AID-induced DNA breakage and reduced mutation frequencies in IgH loci, in both S and variable regions, and in non-IgH loci, such as metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) and small nucleolar RNA host gene 3 (SNHG3). Global gene expression analysis revealed that Spt6 can act as both a positive and negative transcriptional regulator in B cells, affecting approximately 5% of the genes that includes suppressor of Ty4 (Spt4) and AID. Interestingly, Spt6 regulates CSR and AID expression through two distinct histone modification pathways, H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, respectively.     Spt6 is a unique histone chaperone, capable of regulating the histone epigenetic state of both AID targets and the AID locus.     CH12F3-2A cells were transfected with control and Spt6 siRNAs; 24h later, cells were stimulated with CIT to induce CSR. Total RNA was extracted from control and Spt6 siRNA treated cells for mRNA expression profiling.
 E-GEOD-39402 - Gene expression profile of epithelial ovarian tumor tissue of a transgenic mouse model compared to normal mouse ovary tissue The etiology of ovarian cancer is poorly understood, mainly due to the lack of an appropriate experimental model for studying the onset and progression of this disease.     We have created a mouse model termed ERalpha d/d in which a conditional deletion of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) gene occurred in the anterior pituitary, but ERalpha expression remained intact in the hypothalamus and the ovary.     The loss of negative-feedback regulation by estrogen (E) at the level of the pituitary led to elevated production of luteinizing hormone (LH) by this tissue.     Hyperstimulation of ovarian cells by LH resulted in increased steroidogenesis, leading to high circulating levels of progesterone, testosterone and E.  The ERalpha d/d mice exhibited formation of palpable ovarian epithelial tumors starting at 5 months of age, and by 12 months, most mice carrying these tumors died.     Besides proliferating epithelial cells, these tumors also contained an expanded population of stromal cells, which express P450 aromatase suggesting that these cells acquired the ability to synthesize E. In ERalpha d/d mice, in response to the E produced by the stromal cells, the ERalpha signaling is accentuated in the ovarian epithelial cells, triggering increased ERalpha-dependent gene expression, abnormal cell proliferation, and tumorigenesis.     The ERalpha d/d animal model of ovarian epithelial tumorigenesis will serve as a powerful tool for exploring the involvement of E-dependent signaling pathways in the etiology of ovarian cancer.     To identify aberrantly regulated genes in epithelial ovarian tumors, we performed gene expression profling of ovarian tumor tissue isolated from ERaplha d/d mice and normal ovary tissue isolated from ERaplha f/f control mice.     The ERalpha d/d mouse model was created via conditional deletion of ERalpha by employing the Cre-LoxP strategy.     Transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of progesterone receptor (PR) promoter, termed PR-cre mice, were crossed with mice harboring the ‘floxed’ ERalpha gene (ERalpha f/f) to create the ERalpah d/d mice in which the ERalpha gene is deleted in cells expressing PR. Ovarian tumor tissue was isolated from ERalpha d/d mice and normal ovary tissue was isolated from ERalpha f/f mice at 5 months and 10 months of age.     Tissues were snap frozen and total RNA was isolated.     Total RNA was pooled from 3 mice for each sample subjected to microarray analysis.
 E-GEOD-53480 - Expression data from Tg4510 and Wild-type mice after AAVTFEB injection We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression after 4 months of TFEB overexpression in the brain.     Groups of Tg4510 and Wild-type mice were injected at P0 in the brain.     Those groups of mice and the respectively controls were sacrificed and analyzed after 4 months from the injection.     RNA extraction from the hippocampus and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays was done.
 E-GEOD-28035 - Expression data from mouse oral keratinocyte Keratinocytes are the major constituent of epithelial cells at mucosal surfaces and skin, which cover organs, internal cavities and the body.     Traditionally, keratinocytes have been considered as an inert component of the multilayered epithelium to protect the subepithelial compartments from the pathogenic microorganisms, toxic stimuli and physical trauma.     However, accumulated researches of the airway, gastrointestinal tract and skin have demonstrated that keratinocytes function in the development of the immune system, promotion of pathologic inflammation and even impose diverse decisions on immune cells.     We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression of oral keratinocyte during oral adaptive immune response.     Oral keratinocyte were collected at three time points (control, 48h and 96h) in oral adaptive immune response for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays
 E-GEOD-18218 - Expression data from AFB1-treated GNMT knockout mice We report that liver nodules from 5/8 (62.5%) male and 4/5 (80%) female Gnmt-/- mice were diagnosed as having HCC. Microarray analysis showed that genes involved in the following pathways were deregulated in different stages of tumorigenesis: Methylation, metabolism, signal transduction, cell proliferation, and cell adhesion.     This study reveals that GNMT plays an important role in the prevention of hepatotumorigenesis through regulating detoxification pathways.     We postulate that GNMT is a stress-responsive protein and its expression may account for the gender difference of the susceptibility to liver cancer.     Liver tissues from aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-treated wild-type or Gnmt knockout mice at 11weeks old were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.     Total RNA were mixed in equal proportion from 3 mice.
 E-GEOD-45624 - The FLS (Fatty liver Shionogi) mouse, liver with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) Comparison between livers of FLS mice and livers of DS (DD shionogi) mice We used FLS mice as model animals of human NASH, while DS mice as control animals.     FLS mice develops NASH spontaneously.     DS mouse strain is a sister strain of the FLS mouse strain.     We compared RNA from pooled livers of three FLS mice and three DS mice at 19 weeks.     NASH in livers from FLS mice was confirmied pathologically while simple steatosis of DS mouse livers confirmed.
 E-GEOD-23937 - Expression data from GNMT knockout mice cerebral cortex We report that Gnmt-/- mice have abnormal behavior including spontaneous locomotion activity, PPI, TST and FST. Microarray analysis showed that genes expression profiles  in male Gnmt -/- mice  Keywords: Gnmt knockout Cerebral cortex tissues from wild-type or Gnmt knockout mice were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.     For 4 weeks old mice, total RNA were mixed in equal proportion from 3 mice.
 E-GEOD-31947 - Profiling aorta from high fat diet (HFD)-fed ApoE KO and wild type C57BL6 mice This program aimed to understand gene expression changes in aorta during atherosclerotic lesion progression with an objective to identify genes that may present new opportunities for drug intervention The HFD-fed ApoE KO mice aorta profiling data was analyzed by identifying genes that were up- and down-regulated at selected p value and fold change in comparison to the HFD-fed WT C57BL6 controls.
 E-GEOD-27546 - Effects of HMGN variants on cellular transcription profile HMGN (high mobility group N) is a family of intrinsically disordered nuclear proteins that binds to nucleosomes, alters the structure of chromatin and affects transcription.     A major unresolved question is the extent of functional specificity, or redundancy, between  the various members of the HMGN protein family.     Here we analyze the transcriptional profile of cells in which the expression of various HMGN proteins has been either deleted or doubled.     The results reveal an HMGN-variant specific effect on the fidelity of the cellular transcription profile, indicating that functionally, the various HMGN subtypes are not fully redundant.     RNA was collected from either primary knock-out MEFs or SV40-transformed MEFs and MIN6 cells over expressing various HMGN proteins and mutants and hybridized to Affymetrix arrays.     We obtained a double ammount of HMGN proteins in MEFs and MIN6 cells by retroviral infection and subsequent selection procedure.     We collected all infected cells (pools, not clones) in order to eliminate the effect of viral integration in the genome.
 E-GEOD-22935 - Arginine utilization following mycobacteria infection in macrophages is dependent on autocrine-paracrine signaling Nitric oxide (NO) produced by macrophages (MØs) is toxic to both host tissues and invading pathogens and its regulation is therefore essential to suppress host cytotoxicity.     MØ arginase 1 (Arg1) inhibits NO production by competing with NO synthases for arginine, the common substrate of NO synthases and arginases.     Two signal transduction pathways control Arg1 expression in MØs. First, a MyD88-dependent pathway induces Arg1 in intracellular infections, while a second Stat6-dependent pathway is required for Arg1 expression in alternativelyactivated MØs. We found that mycobacteria-infected MØs produce soluble factors that induce Arg1 in an autocrine-paracrine manner via Stat3. We identify these factors as IL-6, IL-10 and GCSF. We further establish that Arg1 expression is controlled by the MyD88-dependent production of IL-6, IL-10 and G-CSF rather than cell intrinsic MyD88 signaling to Arg1. Our data reveal the MyD88-dependent pathway of Arg1induction following BCG infection requires Stat3 activation and may result in the development of an immunosuppressive niche in granulomas due to the induced Arg1 production in surrounding uninfected MØs We used microarrays to perform genome wide expression analysis in mycobacteria-infected macrophages from C57Bl/6 WT and MyD88-knockout mice.
 E-TABM-643 - Transcription profiling of mouse mammary tumors from animals which have exons 4-7 of the Lkb1 gene deleted Heterozygous germ-line mutations in the LKB1 (STK11) gene cause Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by hamartomatous polyposis of the gastrointestinal tract and an increased risk of colorectal, breast, ovarian, testicular and cervical cancer.     To model the effects of LKB1 mutation in mammary tumourigenesis, we have used a conditional gene targeting strategy to generate a mouse in which exons 4-7 of the Lkb1 gene encoding the kinase domain of the protein are deleted specifically in the mammary gland.     Mammary gland tumours arise in these mice with a latency of 46-85 weeks and occur in the thoracic or inguinal glands.     These mammary gland tumours were characterised as Grade 2 invasive ductal carcinomas or solid papillary carcinomas and resemble those arising in PJS patients.     This mouse model of Lkb1 deficiency provides a potentially useful tool to investigate the role of Lkb1 in tumourigenesis and to guide the development of therapeutic approaches
 E-GEOD-24775 - Genome-wide expression analysis of the mouse pars tuberalis (PT) under chronic short-day and long-day conditions Living organisms detect seasonal changes in day length (photoperiod), and alter their physiological functions accordingly, to fit seasonal environmental changes.     This photoperiodic system is implicated in seasonal affective disorders and the season-associated symptoms observed in bipolar disease and schizophrenia.     Thyroid-stimulating hormone beta subunit (Tshb), induced in the pars tuberalis (PT), plays a key role in the pathway that regulates animal photoperiodism.     However, the upstream inducers of Tshb expression remain unknown.     Here we show that late-night light stimulation acutely triggers the Eya3-Six1 pathway, which directly induces Tshb expression.     Using melatonin-proficient CBA/N mice, which preserve the photoperiodic Tshb-expression response, we performed a genome-wide expression analysis of the PT under chronic short-day and long-day conditions.     These data comprehensively identified long-day and short-day genes, and indicated that late-night light stimulation induces long-day genes.     We verified this by advancing and extending the light period by 8 hours, which acutely induced Tshb expression, within one day.     In a genome-wide expression analysis under this condition, we searched for candidate upstream genes by looking for expression that preceded Tshb’s, and identified Eya3 gene.     These results elucidate the comprehensive transcriptional photoperiodic response in the PT, revealing the complex regulation of Tshb expression and unexpectedly rapid response to light changes in the mammalian photoperiodic system.     Mice were separated into 2 groups.     One group was maintained under the short-day conditions (light: dark = 8 h:16 h, ZT0 = lights on, ZT8 = lights off, 400 lux) and the other was housed under long-day conditions (light:dark = 16 h:8 h, ZT0 = lights on, ZT16 = lights off, 400 lux) for 2 weeks.     The PTs of both groups were retrieved every 4 h for 1 day (6 time points for each group), starting at ZT0. For the experiments performed during the first day of the long-day conditions, we applied two different conditions, following 3 weeks under short-day conditions.     In one, the light-onset was advanced by 8 hours (advance condition), and in the other, the dark period was delayed by 8 hours (delay condition). PTs from both groups were obtained every 4 h for 1 day, starting at the lights-on time.     (Lights on for the advance condition was ZT16 as defined by the short-day condition.     Lights on for the delay condition was ZT0).  We sampled 25 mice at each time point.     This whole procedure was repeated twice (n = 2) to obtain experimental replicates.
 E-GEOD-4416 - Transcription profiling of mouse isolated granulocyte macrophage progenitors were incubated with a retrovirus that expressed either GFP or MLL-AF9 and GFP Leukemias and other cancers possess a rare population of cells capable of self-renewal, and eradication of these cancer stem cells is likely necessary for long-term cancer-free survival.     Given that both normal and cancer stem cells are capable of self-renewal the extent to which cancer stem cells resemble normal tissue stem cells is a critical issue if targeted therapies are to be developed.      We introduced the MLL-AF9 fusion protein encoded by the t(9;11)(p22;q23) found in human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) into murine committed granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMP). The resultant leukemias contained cells with an immunophenotype similar to normal GMP that were highly enriched for leukemia stem cells (LSC). Detailed gene expression comparisons between normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), committed progenitors, and the LSC population demonstrated the LSC were globally more similar to the normal GMP than any other population.     However, a subset of genes highly expressed in normal stem cells was re-activated in the LSC. These data demonstrate LSC can be generated from committed progenitors without widespread reprogramming of gene expression, and a leukemia self-renewal associated signature is activated in the process.     Our findings define progression from normal hematopoietic progenitor to leukemia stem cell, and suggest that targeting a self-renewal program expressed in an abnormal context may be possible.      Experiment Overall Design: RNA from normal GMP, GMP-like cells isolated from leukemic bone marrow (LGMP) and cells derived from the in vitro propagation of LGMP were hybridized to affymetrix microarrays.
 E-GEOD-27261 - Dmrt1 (doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1) conditional knockout expression analysis of P28 testes Dmrt1 (doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1) is a conserved transcriptional regulator of male differentiation required for testicular development in vertebrates.      This study examines the result of conditional removal of Dmrt1 from Sertoli cells in P28 testis tissue.     Testes from P28 Dmrt1 flox/flox mice were compared to testes from P28 Dmrt1 flox/flox mice with the Sertoli cell-specific Sf1 (Nr5a1; MGI:1346833) or Dhh (MGI:94891) promoters driving Cre expression.
 E-GEOD-28002 - Gene expression of the whole mouse eye Background Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the elderly population worldwide.     Recent studies have demonstrated strong genetic associations between AMD and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within genes such as CFH and HTRA1. However, we have identified monozygotic twins discordant for AMD phenotypes (one with disease, the other without disease), suggesting that an epigenetic mechanism may also contribute to the pathogenesis of AMD.  Methods We identified two twin pairs with phenotypic discordance of AMD. We obtained genomic DNA from their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and subjected them to DNA methylation-chip analysis (MeDIP-chip) that profiled genome-wide DNA methylation patterns on promoters of all genes and microRNAs. We next utilized the Methyl-Profiler DNA methylation assays to detect the methylation status of selected promoters.     Flow cytometry and quantitative real-time PCR were used to detect the expression of the selected gene in peripheral blood cells, as well as in retinal and choroidal tissues of AMD patients and non-AMD controls.      Results Our MeDIP-chip analysis identified 256 genes with hypo-methylated promoters only in the twins with AMD and 744 genes with hyper-methylated promoters only in the twins with AMD. Importantly, the promoter region of IL17RC was associated with hypo-methylated CpG sites only in the twins with AMD but not in the twins without AMD. We also found the association of the hypo-methylated IL17RC promoter with AMD in 7 pairs of siblings with discordant AMD pathology (P=0.003), as well as an independent patient cohort (95 neovascular wet and 107 geographic atrophy dry AMD patients as well as 96 non-AMD controls (95% CI, 0.01-0.10, P=9.8x10-8 for wet AMD vs. control; 95% CI, 0.05-0.32, P=2.2x10-5 for dry AMD vs. control)). Interestingly, we did not find an association between the levels of methylation on the IL17RC promoter with the previously identified genetic risk alleles in CFH, HTRA1, and ARMS2. We demonstrated an elevated expression of the IL-17RC protein in CD14+ monocytes in the peripheral blood of AMD patients as compared to non-AMD controls.     These IL-17RC+ monocytes have elevated expression of CXCR1, CXCR2, and CXCR4. In addition, IL17RC was expressed only in the retinal and choroidal tissues from AMD patients but not from age-matched controls.      Conclusions We show an association of the hypo-methylated IL17RC promoter with AMD, which resulted in the elevated expression of IL-17RC in peripheral blood cells as well as the retinal and choroidal tissues of AMD patients.     Our study suggests that the hypo-methylated IL17RC promoter and elevated expression of IL-17RC can potentially serve as biomarkers for the diagnosis of AMD, while IL-17RC can be a new therapeutic target for AMD. In addition, our results strongly suggest an epigenetic control mechanism of AMD pathogenesis.     The Affymetrix MOE430 2.0 GeneChip was used to detect gene expression patterns within the whole eye of C57B/6 normal mice.
 E-GEOD-44825 - Study of the association of DNAhsp65 immunotherapy and conventional drugs in experimental tuberculosis Despite substantial investments, tuberculosis remains one of the biggest challenges in public health.     DNA-immunotherapy is increasingly being suggested as a possibility to assist conventional treatment of tuberculosis.     This strategy could allow treatment to be more efficient, faster and with advantages and modulate the host immune response, as demonstrated by our group with DNAhsp65 vaccine (Silva, Bonato et al., Gene Therapy, 2005). Based on this evidences, we performed a microarray assay to stydy the functional effects of DNAhsp65 immunotherapy associated with conventional chemotherapy in murine experimental tuberculosis.     Briefly, we used a murine model of tuberculosis treatment compost by DNAhsp65 vaccine, or rifampicin and isoniazid or both therapies combined and performed a comprehensive analysis of its effects on gene expression of host’s lung . Female BALB/c mice,8 weeks old, were inoculated with 1.0 × 10e5 viable bacilli of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv strain by the intra-tracheal route in a level III bio-safety room facility (day 0). They were segregated in four groups, described below, with three animals each one.     Control – just infected and not treated.     Immunotherapy - Thirty days after challenge, 50 μg of plasmid with DNA-insert (DNAhsp65) was administered by intramuscular injection in 50 μL of 25% saccharose  solution in saline into each quadriceps muscle, in four occasions, and  at 10-days intervals, performing a final dose of 400 μg of plasmid DNAhsp65 per animal.     Control infected mice received saline.     Chemotherapy - Thirty days after infection, animals were treated with water solution of isoniazid (25 mg/Kg, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and rifampicin (20 mg/Kg, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) daily, during 30 days, by gavage.     Control infected mice received the same volume of water.     Association - The therapeutical association consists of the both therapeutical approaches, as described above.     Ten days after the end of treatments, mice were killed by cervical dislocation under mild anesthesia, and lungs were removed to RNA extraction.
 E-GEOD-61086 - Expression data from mouse adult and pups heart and hippocampal tissue. To assess in order to assess potential disparities in gene expression due to developmental differences we performed a comparison between hippocampus and heart tissues from rat and mouse pup (one week old) and adult (10 week old) animals.     Using heart and hippocampal tissue from mouse  (C57BL/6) and rat (Sprague Dawley) we investigate via microarrays, gene expression divergence at the tissue level between a Brain and a Non-brain tissue.     We also investigated any developement difference in gene expression between pups and adult animals.     For the pups samples we used 3 biological replicates and for the adult samples we used 2 biological replicates with 2 technical replicates for each.
 E-GEOD-34423 - Phenobarbital mediates an epigenetic switch at the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) target gene Cyp2b10 in the liver of B6C3F1 mice [Expression array]. Evidence suggests that epigenetic perturbations are involved in the adverse effects associated with some drugs and toxicants, including certain classes of non-genotoxic carcinogens.     Such epigenetic changes (altered DNA methylation and covalent histone modifications) may take place at the earliest stages of carcinogenesis and their identification holds great promise for biomedical research.     Here, we evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of genome-wide epigenomic and transcriptomic profiling in phenobarbital (PB)-treated B6C3F1 mice, a well-characterized rodent model of non-genotoxic liver carcinogenesis.     Methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation (MeDIP)-coupled microarray profiling of 17,967 promoter regions and 4,566 intergenic CpG islands was combined with genome-wide mRNA expression profiling to identify liver tissue-specific PB-mediated DNA methylation and transcriptional alterations.     Only a limited number of significant anti-correlations were observed between PB-induced transcriptional and promoter-based DNA methylation perturbations.     However, the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) target gene Cyp2b10 was found to be concomitantly hypomethylated and transcriptionally activated in a liver tissue-specific manner following PB treatment.     Furthermore, analysis of active and repressive histone modifications using chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed a strong PB-mediated epigenetic switch at the Cyp2b10 promoter.     Our data reveal that PB-induced transcriptional perturbations are not generally associated with broad changes in the DNA methylation status at proximal promoters and suggest that the drug-inducible CAR pathway regulates an epigenetic switch from repressive to active chromatin at the target gene Cyp2b10. This study demonstrates the utility of integrated epigenomic and transcriptomic profiling for elucidating early mechanisms and biomarkers of non-genotoxic carcinogenesis.     29–32 days old male B6C3F1/Crl (C57BL/6 ♂ x C3H/He ♀) mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Germany). Animals were allowed to acclimatise for 5 days prior to being randomly divided into two treatment groups (n = 10) and phenobarbital (Sigma 04710, 0.05% (w/v) in drinking water) was administered to one group through ad libitum access to drinking water for 28 days.     Mice were checked daily for activity and behavior and sacrificed on the last day of dosing (day 28). Blood was withdrawn for PK analysis and target (liver) and non-target (kidney) tissues removed, split into several sections, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for subsequent analyses.     Total RNA from liver and kidney was purified and processed for Affymetrix gene expression profiling while genomic DNA was prepared for promoter array based methylome analysis using the Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) procedure.     Remaining tissue material was used for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to analyze histone modifications at individual promoters.     Plasma samples were also collected to evaluate phenobarbital exposure in individual animals by LC-MS.
 E-GEOD-29055 - Microarray skeletal muscle PPARbeta overexpressing mice This experiment was conducted to identify target genes of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta (PPARb) in skeletal muscle of transgenic mice that overexpressed PPARb. The following abstract from the submitted manuscript describes the major findings of this work.      The Nuclear Receptor Transcription Factor PPARbeta/delta Programs Muscle Glucose Metabolism.     Zhenji Gan, Eileen Burkart-Hartman, Dong-Ho Han, Brian Finck, Teresa C. Leone, John Holloszy, and Daniel P. Kelly.      To identify new gene regulatory pathways controlling skeletal muscle energy metabolism, comparative studies were conducted on muscle-specific transgenic mouse lines expressing the nuclear receptors, PPARalpha (MCK-PPARalpha) or PPARbeta/delta (MCK-PPARbeta/delta).  MCK-PPARbeta/delta mice are known to have enhanced exercise performance whereas MCK-PPARalpha mice perform at low levels.     Transcriptional profiling revealed that the lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh)b/Ldha gene expression ratio is increased in MCK-PPARbeta/delta muscle, an isoenzyme shift that diverts pyruvate into the mitochondrion for the final steps of glucose oxidation.     PPARbeta/delta gain- and loss-of-function studies in skeletal myotubes demonstrated that PPARbeta/delta, but not PPARalpha, interacts with the exercise inducible kinase, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), to synergistically activate Ldhb gene transcription by cooperating with myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A), in a PPARbeta/delta ligand-independent manner.     MCK-PPARbeta/delta muscle was shown to have high glycogen stores, increased levels of GLUT4, and augmented capacity for mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation suggesting a broad reprogramming of glucose utilization pathways.     Lastly, exercise studies demonstrated that MCK-PPARbeta/delta mice had lower circulating levels of lactate compared to non-transgenic controls, while exhibiting supranormal performance on a high intensity exercise regimen.     These results identify a transcriptional regulatory mechanism that increases capacity for muscle glucose utilization in a pattern that resembles the effects of exercise training.     Keywords: muscle, exercise, nuclear receptors, glucose metabolism, gene regulation RNA from two wild-type (non-transgenic (NTG)) and two PPARbeta overexpressing (MCK-PPARb) mice was analyzed.     Two replicates of each are provided.
 E-GEOD-17478 - Transcription profiling of mouse model of cardiac failure - particulate matter effect on mouse model of cardiac failure: lung and heart left ventricle Particulate Matter Triggers Carotid Body Dysfunction, Respiratory Dysynchrony and Cardiac Arrhythmias in Mice with Cardiac Failure; The mechanistic link between human exposure to airborne particulate matter (PM) pollution and the increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality observed in people with congestive heart failure (CHF) is unknown.     We now show that exposure of genetically-engineered mice with CHF (expressing a cardiac-specific CREB mutant transcription factor) to ambient PM (collected in Baltimore, mean aerodynamic diameter 1.9 um) unmasks severe autonomic morbidities manifested as significant reductions in heart rate variability, respiratory dysynchrony and increased frequency of serious ventricular arrhythmias, features not observed in PM-challenged wild type mice without CHF. PM exposure in CREB mice with CHF reflexly triggers autonomic dysfunction via heightened carotid body function as evidenced by pronounced afferent nerve responses to hypoxia and marked depression of breathing by hyperoxia challenge.     Genomic analyses of lung and ventricular tissues revealed PM-induced molecular signatures of inflammation and oxidative stress.     These findings in a murine model of cardiac failure provide the first direct assessment of autonomic function in response to PM challenge and are highly consistent with current epidemiologic findings on cardiovascular morbidity in susceptible PM-exposed human populations.     We utilized a murine model of dilated cardiomyopathy to address potential mechanistic links between PM exposure and the development of life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias.     Experiment Overall Design: four group (n=3) of animals were treated by PBS or particulate matter (20mg/kg 1.9µm particulate matter) in Wild type or CD-1 dominate negative mice
 E-GEOD-8513 - Transcription profiling of mouse with human solid tumors eradicated with an intravenously injected light-emitting oncolytic Vaccinia virus Previously we reported that a recombinant vaccinia virus (VACV) carrying a light-emitting fusion gene enters, replicates in, and reveals the locations of tumors in mice.     A new recombinant VACV, GLV-1h68, as a simultaneous diagnostic and therapeutic agent, was constructed by inserting three expression cassettes (encoding Renilla luciferase-green fluorescent protein (RUC-GFP) fusion, b-galactosidase, and b-glucuronidase) into the F14.5L, J2R (encoding thymidine kinase, TK), and A56R (encoding hemagglutinin, HA) loci of the viral genome, respectively.     Intravenous (i.v.) injections of GLV-1h68 (1 × 107 pfu/mouse) into nude mice with established (500 mm3)  subcutaneous (s.c.) GI-101A human breast tumors were used to evaluate its toxicity, tumor targeting specificity and oncolytic efficacy.     GLV-1h68 demonstrated an enhanced tumor targeting specificity and much reduced toxicity compared to its parental LIVP strains.     The tumors colonized by GLV-1h68 exhibited growth, inhibition, and regression phases followed by tumor eradication within 130 days in 95% of the mice tested.     Tumor regression in live animals was monitored in real time based on decreasing light emission, hence demonstrating the concept of a combined oncolytic virus-mediated tumor diagnosis and therapy system.     Transcriptional profiling of regressing tumors based on a mouse-specific platform revealed gene expression signatures consistent with immune defense activation, inclusive of interferon stimulated genes (STAT-1 and IRF-7), cytokines, chemokines and innate immune effector function.     These findings suggest that immune activation may combine with viral oncolysis to induce tumor eradication in this model, providing a novel perspective for the design of oncolytic viral therapies for human cancers.     Objective: To determine the gene expression changes induced by GLV-1h68 vaccinia virus injection in mouse carrying human breast cancer implant and leading to tumor eradication.     Methods: Gene expression was analyzed using oligonucleotide microarrays.     Responsiveness to vaccina virus injection was assessed by toxicity and survival study, gene expression anaysis and tumor volume change.     Result: The tumors colonized by GLV-1h68 exhibited growth, inhibition, and regression phases followed by tumor eradication within 130 days in 95% of the mice tested.     Tumor regression in live animals was monitored in real time based on decreasing light emission, hence demonstrating the concept of a combined oncolytic virus-mediated tumor diagnosis and therapy system.     Transcriptional profiling of regressing tumors based on a mouse-specific platform revealed gene expression signatures consistent with immune defense activation, inclusive of interferon stimulated genes (STAT-1 and IRF-7), cytokines, chemokines and innate immune effector function.     Conclusion: Our findings suggest that immune activation may combine with viral oncolysis to induce tumor eradication in this model, providing a novel perspective for the design of oncolytic viral therapies for human cancers.     Experiment Overall Design: tumor tissues 3 and 6 weeks post virus injection
 E-GEOD-13567 - Transcription profiling of human NIH-3T3 US28-expressing and mock-transfected stablecell lines The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes the chemokine receptor US28 that exhibits constitutive activity.     NIH-3T3 cells stably transfected with US28 present a pro-angiogenic and transformed phenotype both in vitro and in vivo.     We used gene expression profiling to determine how US28 constitutive activity modulates expression of genes compared to mock-transfected cells.     Experiment Overall Design: We isolated RNA from two different clonal stable cell lines of NIH-3T3 cells transfected either either mock or US28-WT and analysed these 4 RNA samples using Affymetrix mouse genome arrays.
 E-GEOD-16661 - Differential gene expression in CD11b+ splenocytes from mice subject to social threat vs. control Gene expression profiling was carried out on splenocyte mRNA samples collected from 10 animals subject to repeated social threat (pooled into 2 groups of 5) and 10 animals subject to non-threatening control conditions (pooled into 2 groups of 5).  The primary research question is whether gene expression differs in CD11b+ splenocytes from animals exposed to social threat vs non-threatening control conditions.      Keywords: Risk prediction RNA from 5 mice/sample was pooled to generate 4 total samples: 2 from mice subject to repeated social threat, and 2 from control mice.
 E-GEOD-26076 - Mouse conjunctival forniceal gene expression during postnatal development and its regulation by Kruppel-like factor 4 Purpose: To identify the changes in postnatal mouse conjunctival forniceal gene expression and their regulation by Klf4 around eye opening stage when the goblet cells first appear.     Methods: Laser-capture-microdissection was used to collect conjunctival forniceal epithelial cells from postnatal-day (PN) 9, PN14 and PN20 wild-type (WT), and PN14 Klf4-conditional null (Klf4CN) mice, where goblet cells are absent, developing, present, and missing, respectively.     Microarrays were used to compare gene expression among these four groups.     Expression of selected genes was validated by Q-RT-PCR, and spatiotemporal expression assessed by in situ hybridization.      Results: We identified 668, 251, 1160 and 139 genes that were upregulated and 492, 377, 1419 and 57 genes that were downregulated between PN9 and PN14, PN14 and PN20, PN9 and PN20, and PN14 WT and Klf4CN conjunctiva, respectively.     Transcription factors Spdef, FoxA1 and FoxA3 that regulate goblet cell development in other mucosal epithelia, and epithelial specific Ets (ESE) transcription factor family members were upregulated during conjunctival development.     Mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) was favored and diverse pathways related to glycoprotein biosynthesis, mucosal immunity, signaling, endocytic and neural regulation were affected during conjunctival development.     Conjunctival Klf4-target genes differed significantly from the previously identified corneal Klf4-target genes, implying tissue-dependant regulatory targets for Klf4. Conclusions: We have identified the changes in gene expression accompanying mouse conjunctival development and the role of Klf4 in this process.     These studies provide new probes to study conjunctival epithelial development and function, and reveal that the gene regulatory network required for goblet cell development is conserved across different mucosal epithelia.     Three independent samples in each of four developmental groups
 E-GEOD-24971 - Renal Dysfunction in the Setting of Massive Hepatic Necrosis: A Network-based Analysis in a Mouse To date, no published reports (human or animal) have examined the impact of acute liver failure on global gene expression profiles in remote organ systems like the kidney.      In this study, we have characterized a model of acute kidney injury (AKI) using two highly-accurate techniques for assessing renal function in a mouse.     In this model, mice developed massive hepatocyte necrosis, disordered hepatosplanchnic hemodynamics, and alterations consistent with ALF. Simultaneously, acute renal insufficiency developed, manifesting as oliguria, azotemia, and decreased glomerular filtration.      In this paper, renal function is corroborated using two independent methodologies.     These techniques are used in addition to hemodynamic, biochemical, and histologic analyses to demonstrate that acute hepatic injury promulgates renal dysfunction in a mouse.     Similar to network-based analyses conducted in other models of human disease, we present a comprehensive, genome-wide assessment of the differentially-regulated, renal transcriptome in the setting of massive hepatic necrosis.     Using this approach, mice receiving the select hepatotoxin D-(+)-Galactosamine HCl (GalN) were found to have significant perturbations in renal pathways related to lipid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry, the cell cycle, molecular transport, and amino acid metabolism, despite normal renal histology.     By combining data obtained from clinical, physiologic, and molecular investigations, our findings have direct implications for exploring potential pharmacological approaches to the prevention of AKI in this setting.     Male C57BL6 mice weighing 20 grams were given i.p. injections of the select hepatotoxin D-(+)-Galactosamine HCl (GalN).  Animals were divided into 3 groups (n =3 per group):  1)  Saline control injection (necropsy at 24 hours), 2) 4.5 g / kg GalN injection (necropsy at 24 hours), and 3)  4.5 g / kg i.p. injection (necropsy at 48 hours).  At necropsy, liver and kidney were harvested after in situ perfusion with 10 ml of ribonuclease (RNAse)-free PBS and 10 ml of RNA Later reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Total cellular RNA was isolated from morcellated whole kidneys and liver using a commercial kit (RNA Easy, Qiagen). To extract RNA, 30 mg of tissue was processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.     RNA integrity was monitored using an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). One microgram of denatured RNA was used for cDNA synthesis, with reverse transcription carried out using random hexamer primers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR), 100 ng of cDNA template, 20 μL of SYBR green master mix and pre-optimized and validated mouse primer sets (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) were used and analyzed in an ABI Prism 7000 Thermocycler or a Roche LightCycler.     Relative expression of gene targets was determined by the ΔΔCt method first normalizing to expression of the housekeeping gene, GAPDH, and then to expression in the sham treated control.     Expression of RPLP0 was included in the analysis to verify the “housekeeping” status of GAPDH. Efficiencies for each primer pair were determined using the REST program  and verified to be comparable to efficiencies for housekeeping gene primer pairs Equal amounts of total RNA from the three individual mice for each treatment condition were prepared for Affymetrix array hybridization according to the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual (www.affymetrix.com). A total of 18 array measurements were made (sham, 24 hr., and 48 hr. for each animal, liver and kidney, respectively).   These correspond to the various CEL files and are labeled 1-18.  All samples were hybridized to the GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) and preprocessed using R packages affy and gcRMA from the Bioconducter project.      Greater than 45,000 transcripts and variants on the mouse genome 430 2.0 gene chip array were analyzed.     Probe sets significantly perturbed after GalN administration were identified using rank product analysis.     False discovery rate was used to control for multiple comparisons using the method of Benjamini and Hochberg.     Adjusted p-values  0.05 were considered significant.
 E-GEOD-26464 - High Fat Diet Reduces the Expression of Glutathione Peroxidase 3 in Mouse Prostate High fat diets are known to be a risk factor for prostate cancer.     In this study, we investigated the effect of high fat diet on mouse prostate gene expression.       C57BL/6J mice were fed either a control or high fat diet for 12 weeks.     Microarray analyses were performed on mouse ventral prostate (VP) and dorsolateral prostate (DLP), followed by canonical pathway analysis and regulatory network identification.     mRNA changes were confirmed by real time PCR.   Approximately 2,125, and 1,194 genes responded significantly to the high fat diet in VP, DLP, respectively.     Pathways and networks related to oxidative stress, glutathione metabolism, NRF-mediated oxidative stress response and NF-kappaB were all differentially regulated by high fat diet.     GPx3 mRNA levels were decreased by approximately 2-fold by high fat diet in all 3 prostate lobes.     In human non-transformed prostate cells (PrSC, PrEC and BPH-1), cholesterol loading decreased GPx3 expression, and increased H2O2 levels of culture medium.     Troglitazone increased GPx3 expression in 3 normal prostate cells, and decreased H2O2 levels.     In addition, troglitazone attenuated cholesterol-induced H2O2 increase.     Tissue from prostate cancer biopsies had decreased GPx3 mRNA and its level was inversely related to the Gleason score.     High fat diet alters pathways related to many genes concerned with oxidative stress.     GPx3, a gene identified by this analysis, was found to be down regulated by high fat diet and appears be decreased in human prostate cancers, suggesting that GPx3 may have a possible role in modulating carcinogenesis.     Control group:5 C57BL/6J mice (Taconic, Hudson, NY), 8-weeks of age, fed control diet ad libitum for 12 weeks; Experimental group: 5 C57BL/6J mice (Taconic, Hudson, NY), 8-weeks of age, fed ad libitum high fat diet for 12 weeks.
 E-GEOD-6136 - Transcription profiling of mouse BRD2-mediated lymphomas The dual bromodomain protein Brd2 is closely related to the basal transcription factor TAFII250, which is essential for cyclin A transactivation and mammalian cell cycle progression.     In transgenic mice, constitutive lymphoid expression of Brd2 causes a malignancy most similar to human diffuse large B cell lymphoma.     We compare the genome-wide transcriptional expression profiles of these lymphomas with those of proliferating and resting normal B cells.     Transgenic tumors reproducibly show differential expression of a large number of genes important for cell cycle control and lymphocyte biology; expression patterns are either tumor-specific or proliferation-specific.     Several of their human orthologs have been implicated in human lymphomagenesis.     Others correlate with human disease survival time.     BRD2 is underexpressed in some subtypes of human lymphoma and these subtypes display a number of similarities to the BRD2-mediated murine tumors.     We illustrate with a high degree of detail that cancer is more than rampant cellular proliferation, but involves the additional transcriptional mobilization of many genes, some of them poorly characterized, which show a tumor-specific pattern of gene expression.     Experiment Overall Design: 26 samples are included in this series.      Sporadic murine E-mu-BRD2 mediated lymphomas are divided into three classes by disease severity and compared to either resting or mitogen-activated B Cells.      The resting and activated B Cells are either wildtype or E-mu-BRD2 transgenic.      All samples are on the FVB wildtype background.
 E-GEOD-62039 - Defining a mesenchymal progenitor niche at single cell resolution Most vertebrate organs are composed of epithelium surrounded by support and stromal tissues formed from mesenchyme cells, which are not generally thought to form organized progenitor pools.      Here we use clonal cell labeling with multicolor reporters to characterize individual mesenchymal progenitors in the developing mouse lung.      We observe a diversity of mesenchymal progenitor populations with different locations, movements, and lineage boundaries.      Airway smooth muscle (ASM) progenitors map exclusively to mesenchyme ahead of budding airways.      Progenitors recruited from these tip pools differentiate into ASM around airway stalks; flanking stalk mesenchyme can be induced to form an ASM niche by a lateral bud or by an airway tip plus focal Wnt signal.      Thus, mesenchymal progenitors can be organized into localized and carefully controlled domains that rival epithelial progenitor niches in regulatory sophistication.     Mesenchyme was microdissected from e11.5 and e12.5 lung branch tips and stalks and profiled directly.      Another set of stalk dissections were cultured in either control media or media containing Wnt1.  All experiments done in duplicate.
 E-GEOD-24628 - Subtypes of medulloblastoma have distinct developmental origins Medulloblastoma encompasses a collection of clinically and molecularly diverse tumor subtypes that together comprise the most common malignant childhood brain tumor.      These tumors are thought to arise within the cerebellum, with approximately 25% originating from granule neuron precursor cells (GNPCs) following aberrant activation of the Sonic Hedgehog pathway (hereafter, SHH-subtype).  The pathological processes that drive heterogeneity among the other medulloblastoma subtypes are not known, hindering the development of much needed new therapies.      Here, we provide evidence that a discrete subtype of medulloblastoma that contains activating mutations in the WNT pathway effector CTNNB1 (hereafter, WNT-subtype), arises outside the cerebellum from cells of the dorsal brainstem.     We found that genes marking human WNT-subtype medulloblastomas are more frequently expressed in the lower rhombic lip (LRL) and embryonic dorsal brainstem than in the upper rhombic lip (URL) and developing cerebellum.      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and intra-operative reports showed that human WNT-subtype tumors infiltrate the dorsal brainstem, while SHH-subtype tumors are located within the cerebellar hemispheres.      Activating mutations in Ctnnb1 had little impact on progenitor cell populations in the cerebellum, but caused the abnormal accumulation of cells on the embryonic dorsal brainstem that included aberrantly proliferating Zic1+ precursor cells.      These lesions persisted in all mutant adult mice and in 15% of cases in which Tp53 was concurrently deleted, progressed to form medulloblastomas that recapitulated the anatomy and gene expression profiles of human WNT-subtype medulloblastoma.      We provide the first evidence that subtypes of medulloblastoma have distinct cellular origins.      Our data provide an explanation for the marked molecular and clinical differences between SHH and WNT-subtype medulloblastomas and have profound implications for future research and treatment of this important childhood cancer.     A total of 16 samples are analyzed, repsresenting 4 experimental groups: Ctnnb1 medulloblastoma (3 samples); Ptch1 medulloblastoma (6 samples); embryonic dorsal brainstem (4 samples); and postnatal granule neuron precursor cells (3 samples). Every sample was prepared from a different mouse.
 E-GEOD-31940 - White adipose tissue from aP2-Pex5 knockout and control mice These arrays contain data from gonodal adipose tissue of aP2-Pex5 -/- male mice 4 arrays from gonadal adipose tissue from control mice (Swiss background) are compared with 4 arrays from gonadal adipose tissue of aP2-Pex5 knockout mice.     The latter lack functional peroxisomes in adipose tissue.
 E-GEOD-26070 - A SUMOylated C-terminus fragment of glutamate transporter EAAT2 linked to inherited ALS mediates motor axon impairment Downregulation of expression and activity levels of the astroglial glutamate transporter EAAT2 is thought to be implicated in motor neuron excitotoxicity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We previously reported that EAAT2 is cleaved by caspase-3 at the cytosolic C-terminus domain, impairing the transport activity and generating a proteolytic fragment found to be SUMO1 conjugated (CTE-SUMO1). We show here that this fragment accumulates in the nucleus of spinal cord astrocytes in vivo throughout the disease stages of the SOD1-G93A mouse model of ALS. In vitro expression in spinal cord astrocytes of the C-terminus peptide of EAAT2 (CTE), which was artificially fused to SUMO1 (CTE-SUMO1fus) to mimic the endogenous SUMOylation reaction, recapitulates the nuclear accumulation of the fragment seen in vivo and causes caspase-3 activation and axonal growth impairment in motor neuron-derived NSC-34 cells and primary motor neurons co-cultured with CTE-SUMO1fus-expressing spinal cord astrocytes.     This indicates that CTE-SUMO1fus could trigger non-cell autonomous mechanisms of neurodegeneration.     Prolonged nuclear accumulation of CTE-SUMO1fus in astrocytes leads to their degeneration, although the time frame of the cell-autonomous toxicity is longer than the one for the indirect toxic effect on motor neurons.     As more evidence on the implication of SUMO substrates in neurodegenerative diseases emerges, our observations strongly suggest that the nuclear accumulation in spinal cord astrocytes of a SUMOylated proteolytic fragment of the astroglial glutamate transporter EAAT2 could take part to the pathogenesis of ALS and suggest a novel, unconventional role for EAAT2 in motor neuron degeneration in ALS. Comparison is made between the toxic fragment (SUMO) and the same fragment without lysines that can be sumo-ylated (CTE). Four replicates have been performed for each sample group.
 E-GEOD-30324 - Neurod6 expression defines new retinal amacrine cell subtypes and regulates their fate The goal of this experiment was to define gene expression patterns of two mouse retinal neuron subsets that express the Thy1-mitoCFP-P (MP) transgene.     The two populations expressing the MP transgene are: 1) non-GABAergic, non-glycinergic amacrine cells; and 2) a subset of OFF-type bipolar cells.     We used the VC1.1 monoclonal antibody, which labels amacrine cells (ACs) but not bipolar cells, to separately purify the AC and bipolar populations that express the MP transgene.     Two biological replicates, originating from different litters, were collected for each sample.     RNA was extracted from sorted cells and prepared for hybridization to Affymetrix microarrays.
 E-GEOD-37936 - Context-dependent actions of Exendin-4 on β-cell function and dynamic changes in islet gene expression over time in vivo GLP-1 analogues, such as exendin-4, preserve functional β-cell mass in various model systems and are revolutionising management of type 2 diabetes.     Yet, comparatively little is known about effectiveness in the face of severe β-cell depletion.     Moreover, direct and sequential effects of exendin-4 on islet-specific gene expression over time in vivo are not well characterised.     To address these issues and others, we have examined the time-dependent effects of exendin-4 treatment on β-cell mass regulation alongside accompanying changes in islet gene expression in vivo.     Context-dependent actions were assessed by comparing effects on normal islets and also following massive toxigenetic β-cell ablation in pIns-MYCERTAM transgenic mice in vivo.     Despite over 90% loss of β-cell mass, exendin-4 treatment normalised blood glucose and insulin levels in hyperglycaemic mice, though benefits rapidly waned on withdrawal of treatment.     As exendin-4 did not arrest the decline in β-cell mass or turnover in this study, we could directly isolate effects on function of surviving β-cells.     Improved glucose homeostasis was associated with dynamic changes in multiple islet genes and pathways in vivo favouring glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, such as Irs2, Pdx1, Sox4, glucokinase, and glycolysis pathway.     Several key growth pathways and epigenetic regulators were also differentially expressed.     Thus, even in the face of extensive β-cell loss exendin-4 can markedly improve hyperglycaemia by differential gene expression in surviving islet cells.     Activation of MYCERTAM was achieved through administration of 1mg of 4 hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) by daily intraperitoneal injection.     To assess the effect of exendin-4 on MYCER-induced hyperglycaemia, mice were given either twice-daily subcutaneous (sc) injections of exendin-4 (50ug/kg dissolved in 5mls water), or equivalent volumes of water vehicle, starting 2 days prior to 4OHT injections.     For microarray analyses parallel mouse experiments were set up using 8-12 week old pIns-MYCERTAM male mice either treated with 4OHT or vehicle (peanut oil) and exendin-4 or vehicle, as described, for 4, 8, 16, 32 and 72 hours (n=3 for each time point and for each of four conditions; 4OHT and exendin-4 treated, peanut oil and exendin-4 treated, 4OHT and water treated, peanut oil and water treated).  !Sample data processing = After the quality control step, the following 8 samples out of 60 showing poor reproducibility were excluded from our further study: GSM930242, GSM930247, GSM930251, GSM930263, GSM930264, GSM930289, GSM930291, GSM930298.
 E-MEXP-2836 - Transcription profiling by array of mouse wild type and E-cadherin knockout embryonic stem cells grown with or without cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor We previously observed that E-cadherin knockout embryonic stem cells do not differentiate in the absence of the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (Soncin et al., 2009, Stem Cells 27 p2069-2080). This experiment was designed to compare the transcription profile of E-cadherin KO ES cells cultured in the presence and absence of LIF. We also compared E-cadherin KO ES cells with wild type D3 ES cells grown in the presence of LIF.
 E-GEOD-44563 - Expression data from C2C12 myotubes infected with RML prions Prion infection in animals results in neurodegeneration and eventually death.     To examine the cellular impact of Prion disease, we profiled non-proliferative fully differentiated C2C12 cells, which can replicate prions to high levels.     Results suggest that accumulation of high levels of PrPSc in C2C12 myotubes does not cause any overt cellular dysfunction or molecular pathology.     C2C12 cells were differentiated into confluent myotubes.     Cells were infected or not with 100ul of 10% brain homogenate obtained from a C57BL/6 mouse clinically affected with RML prions.     16 days after infection, cells were collected by scraping and RML was purified.
 E-GEOD-18326 - Transcription profiling of mouse secondary neurospheres cultured from cells taken from mouse forebrains was compared between FoxO3+/+ (wildtype) and FoxO3-/- (null mutant) mice from the FVB/N background In the nervous system, neural stem cells (NSC) are necessary for the generation of new neurons and for cognitive function.     Here we show that FoxO3, a member of a transcription factor family known to extend lifespan in invertebrates, regulates the NSC pool.     We find that adult FoxO3-/- mice have fewer NSC in vivo than wild type counterparts.     NSC isolated from adult FoxO3-/- mice have decreased self-renewal and an impaired ability to generate different neural lineages.     Identification of the FoxO3-dependent gene expression profile in NSC suggests that FoxO3 regulates the NSC pool by inducing a program of genes that preserves quiescence, prevents premature differentiation, and controls oxygen metabolism.     The ability of FoxO3 to prevent the premature depletion of NSC might have important implications for counteracting brain aging in long-lived species.     Experiment Overall Design: mRNA expression from secondary neurospheres cultured from cells taken from mouse forebrains was compared between FoxO3+/+ (wildtype) and FoxO3-/- (null mutant) mice from the FVB/N background.
 E-GEOD-35690 - Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of the expression of cytoskeleton regulator genes in 2 week old male MeCP2 A140V mutant mouse cerebellum The goal of this study was to identify cerebellar gene expression differences between mutant MeCP2 A140V mice and their wild type littermates.     The PCR array used for these experiments was the Mouse Cytoskeleton Regulators Array (Catalog# PAMM-088A) from SABiosciences.     Mice used in this study were 2 week old males.     Total RNA was extracted from whole cerebella of 2 week old male MeCP2 A140V hemizygous mutant mice and their wild type littermates.     For this study, cerebella from 3 mice of each genotype were used and RNA from the cerebellum of each mouse was analyzed separately (ie., triplicate biological replicates). The RNA was purified to remove genomic DNA and was then reverse transcribed for use in quantitative RT-PCR analysis of gene expression using the SABiosciences RT2 profiler PCR array system.      The PCR array used for these experiments was the Mouse Cytoskeleton Regulators Array (Catalog# PAMM-088A).
 E-GEOD-16705 - Transcription profiling of mouse Frizzled4 signaling in cultured retinal endothelial cells Transcriptional profiles of Fz4-/- retinal endothelial cells were compared to that of wild type endothelial cells under various culture conditions.     The goal was to identify the transcriptional response to Frizzled 4 signaling in cultured retinal endothelial cells.     To analyze the Norrin response of WT and Fz4-/- retinal endothelial cells in culture, we co-cultured these cells either with HEK293 cell line that stably expresses Norrin or with control 293 cells.     Experiment Overall Design: To isolate the requisite retinal endothelial cell lines, we crossed Fz4-/- and control animals into the Immorto-mouse line in which a gamma interferon responsive H2Kb promoter directs the expression of a temperature sensitive SV40 large T-antigen (Jat et al., 1991). When cultured at 33°C in the presence of gamma interferon, this conditional oncogene system extends the proliferative capacity of a variety of cell types, which can be subsequently analyzed under phenotypically reverting conditions (37°C without gamma interferon). The cell immuno-purification procedure follows that described by Matsubara et al. (2000) and Su et al. (2003). The purified cells were then cultured and passaged at 33°C on dishes coated with 1% gelatin.     For RNA preparation, cells were cultured at 37°C in the absence of interferon gamma.     For the Matrigel experiments, endothelial cells previously starved for 24 hrs in DMEM with 1% FBS were trypsinized and plated on the Matrigel layer.     The cells were incubated in DMEM with 1% FBS for 6 hours at 37°C before harvesting for RNA extraction.     For the 293 cell co-culture experiments, endothelial cells were co-cultured with a human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell line that stably expresses Norrin, or with control 293 cells.
 E-MTAB-1247 - Transcription profiling by array of mouse livers (wildtype vs Xpa-/-p53+/-) to study gene expression changes to the chemical compound  benzo[a]pyrene Gene expression changes to the chemical compound BaP in livers of wildtype and Xpa-/-p53+/- mice
 E-MTAB-1696 - Transcription profiling by array of aorta from ApoE-/- mice exposed to mainstream cigarette smoke for 30 days Aorta gene expression profiles of smoke- and sham-exposed female ApoE-/- mice were analyzed to elucidate the biological networks perturbed by exposure to 600mg TPM/m3 for 4h per day, 5 days a week, for a period of 30 days.     Aortic arches were dissected 24h after the last exposure.
 E-GEOD-20465 - Her2/Neu breast cancer mouse model whole tissue transcriptome Purpose:  We generated extensive transcriptional and proteomic profiles from a Her2-driven mouse model of breast cancer that closely recapitulates human breast cancer.      This report makes these data publicly available in raw and processed forms, as a resource to the community.      Importantly, we previously made biospecimens from this same mouse model freely available through a sample repository, so researchers can obtain samples to test biological hypotheses without the need of breeding animals and collecting biospecimens.     Experimental design:  Twelve datasets are available, encompassing 841 LC-MS/MS experiments (plasma and tissues) and 255 microarray analyses of multiple tissues (thymus, spleen, liver, blood cells, and breast).  Cases and controls were rigorously paired to avoid bias.     Results:  In total, 18,880 unique peptides were identified (PeptideProphet peptide error rate ≤1%), with 3884 and 1659 non-redundant protein groups identified in plasma and tissue datasets, respectively.      Sixty-one of these protein groups overlapped between cancer plasma and cancer tissue.       Conclusions and clinical relevance:  These data are of use for advancing our understanding of cancer biology, for software and quality control tool development, investigations of analytical variation in MS/MS data, and selection of proteotypic peptides for MRM-MS.  The availability of these datasets will contribute positively to clinical proteomics.     Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 microarrays were used to profile whole tissues from 5 different tissue types of 25 tumor-bearing and 25 control mice of the Her2/Neu breast cancer mouse model.      The 5 tissues tested were from breast, liver, spleen, blood cell, and thymus.      The tumor-bearing mice were bitransgenic for MMTV-rtTA/TetO-NeuNT, and the control mice were transgenic for TetO-NeuNT only.      The control mice were age- and cage-matched to the tumor-bearing mice.      All samples were lysed and total RNA isolated and amplified prior to hybridization.
 E-GEOD-43825 - Gene expression profiles from mammary tissue of control mice, small K5ΔNβcat hyperplasia, large K5ΔNβcat hyperplasia and K5ΔNβcat tumor Basal-like breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease characterised by the expression of basal cell markers, no oestrogen or progesterone receptor expression and a lack of HER2 overexpression.     Recent studies have linked activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway to basal-like breast cancer.     Transgenic mice expressing N-terminally truncated stabilised beta-catenin in the mammary basal/myoepithelial cell layer (K5deltaNbetacat strain) develop mammary hyperplasias that progress to invasive carcinomas.     Histological and microarray analyses of these lesions have revealed their high similarity to a subset of basal-like human breast tumours with squamous differentiation.     As in human basal-like carcinomas, the Myc pathway was found to be activated in the mammary lesions of K5deltaNbetacat mice.     Mammosphere and transplantation assays showed that a basal cell population with stem/progenitor characteristics was amplified in K5deltaNbetacat mouse preneoplastic glands.     Myc deletion from the mammary basal layer of K5deltaNbetacat mice abolished both basal cell regenerative capacity and tumorigenesis.     These results show that Myc is essential for beta-catenin-induced stem cell amplification and tumorigenesis and that basal stem/progenitor cells may be at the origin of a subset of basal-like breast tumours.     mammary tissue from K5ΔNβcat mice were dissected at successive stages of development (small hyperplasia (n=5), large hyperplasia (n=5), tumor (n=11) and control (n=4)) for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays
 E-GEOD-40513 - Gene expression profile of mouse breast cancer V720 cells treated with vehicle or PD 0332991 D-cyclins represent components of cell cycle machinery.     To test the efficacy of targeting D-cyclins in cancer treatment, we engineered mouse strains which allow acute and global ablation of individual D-cyclins in a living animal.     Ubiquitous shutdown of cyclin D1 or inhibition of cyclin D associated kinase activity in mice bearing ErbB2-driven mammary carcinomas halted cancer progression and triggered tumor-specific senescence, without compromising the animals' health.     Ablation of cyclin D3 in mice bearing T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL) triggered tumorspecific apoptosis.     Such selective killing of leukemic cells can be also achieved by inhibiting cyclin D associated kinase activity in mouse and human T-ALL models.     Hence, contrary to what one might expect from ablation of a cell cycle protein, acute shutdown of a D-cyclin leads not only to cell cycle arrest, but it also triggers tumor cell senescence or apoptosis, and it affects different tumor types through distinct cellular mechanisms.     Inhibiting cyclin D-activity represents a highly-selective anticancer strategy which specifically targets cancer cells without significantly affecting normal tissues.     Mouse breast cancer V720 cells were cultured in the presence of the CDK4/6 inhibitor PD 0332991 (PD; 1 microM) or vehicle (VO) for 24 hrs.     Experiment was done in biological triplicate.     A total of 6 RNA samples (3 vehicle treated and 3 PD 0332991 treated samples) were used for microarray expression analysis.
 E-GEOD-41342 - Data from a time course study of gene expression in a mouse model of osteoarthritis The purpose of this study was to characterize the histologic development of OA in a mouse model where OA is induced by destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM model) and to identify genes regulated during different stages of the disease, using RNA isolated from the joint “organ” and analyzed using microarrays.427 genes from the microarrays passed consistency and significance filters.     There was an initial up-regulation at 2 and 4 weeks of genes involved in morphogenesis, differentiation, and development, including growth factor and matrix genes, as well as transcription factors including Atf2, Creb3l1, and Erg. Most genes were off or down-regulated at 8 weeks with the most highly down-regulated genes involved in cell division and the cytoskeleton.     Gene expression increased at 16 weeks, in particular extracellular matrix genes including Prelp, Col3a1 and fibromodulin.The results support a phasic development of OA with early matrix remodelling and transcriptional activity followed by a more quiescent period that is not maintained.     A group of 9 mice was used for collection of RNA at time 0 (before surgery) when the animals were 12 weeks old.     For the other time points, 9 DMM and 9 sham controls were sacrificed at 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks after surgery for RNA isolation.     The tissue included tibial plateau and femoral condyle articular cartilage, subchondral bone with any osteophytes, meniscus, and the joint capsule with synovium was used for RNA isolation.     The tissue was treated with RNAlater® (Invitrogen) prior to freezing and storage at -800 C. RNA was extracted by homogenization using the Precellys 24 tissue homogenizer (Bertin Technologies purchased from MO BIO) and the amount and quality of the RNA was determined using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.     RNA was pooled prior to microarray analysis such that 3 randomly selected samples from each surgical group and time point were pooled to create each biological replicate.     Because 9 mice were used for each experimental group, a total of three biological replicates per group were analyzed using the Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 oligonucleotide arrays as described.     One replicate pool, which was from week two DMM mice, did not meet the RNA integrity level needed for microarray analysis; thus, this pool was not analyzed further, leaving two pools for the week two DMM mice.
 E-GEOD-15895 - Expression data from C2C12 myoblasts transduced with PRDM16 or vector PRDM16 is a 140 kDa transcriptional coregulatory protein.     PRDM16 has been shown to function as a bi-directional switch in brown fat cell fate by stimulating the development of brown fat cells from myf-5 positive myoblastic precursors.     We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the myoblasts-brown fat conversion induced by PRDM16. undifferentiated C2C12 myoblasts were stably expressed with retroviral PRDM16 or vector control.      Total RNAs were isolated by Trizol, and subjected to Affymetrix microarrays.
 E-GEOD-48203 - Expression data from tumoral thymocytes and DP thymocytes expressing an activated form of b-catenin in mouse T cells To assess the importance of the Wnt pathway during T cell develoment, we generated a mouse line (R26-βcat) in which high levels of active β-catenin are maintained throughout T cell development.     Young R26-βcat mice (6-week-old) show a differentiation block at the CD4+CD8+ DP stage.     All R26-βcat mice develop T cell leukemias with a DP phenotype at 5-6 months of age.     To identify the molecular pathways involved in tumor development, we profiled the global gene expression of transformed and pre-transformed DP cells.     Thymocytes from 6-week-old mice (with a normal sized thymus and a polyclonal thymocyte population) were used to define the pre-transformed transcriptome.     RNA from control and pre-leukemic R26-βcat DP thymocytes as well as R26-βcat total tumor cells were extracted and used for transcriptome analysis.
 E-GEOD-51243 - Comparison of the transcriptome of TEL-JAK2- versus activated NOTCH1 (ICN1)-induced T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (mouse) The TEL-JAK2 fusion oncogene and the ICN1 activated allele of NOTCH1 are the result of specific chromosomal translocations in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Mouse models of these diseases (TEL-JAK2 transgenic mice; Carron C.  et al. Blood (2000); a bone marrow transplantation model for ICN1-induced T-ALL) were used  to compare the transcriptional program specific to each oncoprotein in mouse models of these leukemias.     Tumor load was  50% leukemic cells in all selected organs.     Leukemic cells were collected from the thymus of terminally-ill TEL-JAK2 leukemic mice and bone marrow of terminally-ill ICN1 leukemic mice.     RNA was extracted from each sample and processed for hybridization to Affymetrix arrays.
 E-GEOD-29097 - Gene expression between high and low altitude Mus musculus domesticus Analysis of gene expression profiles is an attractive method for discovering how animals respond to environmental challenges in nature.     Compared to low altitudes, high altitudes are characterized by reduced partial pressures of oxygen (hypoxia) and cooler ambient temperatures To better understand how mammals cope with high altitudes, we trapped wild house mice (Mus musculus domesticus) from 3 populations in La Paz, Bolivia (3000 - 3600 m) and 3 populations in Lima, Peru (0 – 200 m). Affymetrix GeneChip® Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays were use to measure mRNA abundance in the livers of these mice.     Eighteen male house mice were trapped from three different locations (3 mice per location)at high alttiude (La Paz, Bolivia, 3600 m) and from three locations  at low altiditude (Lima, Peru, 100 m). Total mRNA was extracted from the livers and used for hybridization of Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse expression set 420.
 E-GEOD-18907 - Gene expression profiling of pregnant and virgin mouse lung and liver Metastasis depends on the ability of tumor cells to establish a relationship with the newly seeded host tissue that is conducive to their survival and proliferation.     Recent evidence suggests that tumor cells regulate their own dissemination by preparing permissive “metastatic niches” within host tissues.     However, the factors that are implicated in rendering tissues permissive for metastatic tumor growth have yet to be fully elucidated.     Breast tumors arising during pregnancy display highly aggressive behaviour and early metastatic proclivity, raising the possibility that pregnancy may constitute a physiological condition of permissiveness for tumor dissemination.     We show that during murine gestation, both the rate and degree of metastatic tumor growth are enhanced irrespective of tumor type and that decreased natural killer (NK) cell activity is responsible for the observed increase in experimental metastasis.     We identify gene expression changes in pregnant mouse lung and liver that bear striking similarity with  reported pre-metastatic niche signatures and several of the up-regulated genes are indicative of myeloid-cell infiltration.     We provide evidence, that CD11b+ Gr-1+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells accumulate in pregnant mice and exert an inhibitory effect on NK cell activity, thereby enhancing metastatic tumor growth.     MDSC have never been evoked in the context of pregnancy and our observations suggest that they may represent a further shared mechanism of immune suppression occurring during gestation and tumor growth.     Three chips were done per organ (liver/lung) and per condition (virgin/pregnant), with equal amounts of RNA from two mice pooled for one chip.
 E-GEOD-32287 - Expression data from wild-type and Rybp-deficient ES cells We used microarrays to investigate a global change in gene expression by conditional depletion of Rybp in mouse ES cells.     Total RNAs were extracted from wild-type and Rybp-deficient ES cells, and were subjected to microarray analysis using Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 arrays
 E-GEOD-14997 - Expression data from young and adult mice after over expression of self MHC class l protein in skeletal muscle. Over expression of MHC Class l protein in skeletal muscle causes myositis.     Phenotype after expression in young mice is  more severe.     We performed gene expression profiling on young and adult mice after over expression of self MHC class l protein in skeletal muscle Muscle from young ( early) , adult (Late) and cntrol (control) mice , n=3 each group, was used for gene expression profiling
 E-GEOD-17256 - Comparison of gene expression profiles between human and mouse monocyte subsets [mouse data] Human and mouse blood each contain two monocyte subsets.     Here, we investigated the extent of their similarity using a microarray approach.     Approximately 300 genes in human and 550 genes in mouse were differentially expressed between subsets.     More than 130 of these gene expression differences were conserved between mouse and human monocyte subsets.     We confirmed numerous differences at the cell surface protein level.     Despite overall conservation, some molecules were conversely expressed between the two species’ subsets, including CD36, CD9, and TREM-1. Furthermore, other differences existed, including a prominent PPARγ signature in mouse monocytes absent in human.     Overall, human and mouse monocyte subsets are far more broadly conserved than currently recognized.     Thus, studies in mice may indeed yield relevant information regarding the biology of human monocyte subsets.     However, differences between the species deserve consideration in models of human disease studied in the mouse.     The two major subsets of monocytes (Ly-6C+ and Ly-6Clo) from 12-week old C57Bl/6 mice were sorted and the RNA extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip® 430 2.0 arrays.     We pooled leukocytes from 5 mice for each sort and sorted 4 separate times for 4 biological replicates.     The two major monocyte subsets (CD16- and CD16+) were isolated from venous heparinized blood from apparently healthy human volunteers using MACS technology with all reagents and tools from Miltenyi Biotec.     Three separate donors were hybridized three different times to Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 array.
 E-GEOD-56903 - Expression data from murine myogenic cells Skeletal muscle has great regenerative capacity, which is dependent on muscle stem cells, also known as satellite cells.     We established the purification system of myogenic cells.     We used microarrays to identify specific genes during the muscle regenerative process.     Myogenic cells were purified at regenerative stages for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.     CTX-2d and CTX-5d are the samples derived from injured muscles 2 days and 5 days after cardiotoxin-injection, respectively.
 E-GEOD-49699 - Hippocampal Gene Expression in Young and Adult Mice with Memory Deficits The purpose of this study was to determine whether there were differences in gene expression in the hippocampus, a part of the brain involved in memory consolidation, between male mice with age-related memory deficits (SAMP8 mice) and control mice with no age-related memory deficits.      The senescence-accelerated mouse (SAMP8) strain exhibits decreased learning and memory and increased amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) accumulation at 12 months compared to 4 months.      To detect differences in gene expression in SAMP8 mice, we used a Control mouse that was a 50% cross between SAMP8 and CD-1 mice and which showed no memory deficits  (50% SAMP8 mouse).  We then compared gene expression in the hippocampus of 4 month and 12 month old SAMP8 and Control mice using Affymetrix gene arrays.      At 12 months, but not at 4 months, pathway analysis revealed significant differences in the Long Term Potentiation (LTP) (6 genes), Phosphatidylinositol Signaling (6 genes), and Endocytosis (10 genes) pathways.      The changes in LTP included MAPK signaling (N-ras, CREB binding protein, protein phosphatase inhibitor 1) and Ca-dependent signaling (PI receptors 1 and 2 and phospholipase C).  Changes in phosphatidylinositol signaling genes suggested altered signaling through PI3-kinase, and Western blotting revealed phosphorylation changes in AKT and 70S6K.  Changes in the Endocytosis pathway involved genes related to clathrin-mediated endocytosis (dynamin and clathrin).  Endocytosis is required for receptor recycling, is involved in Aβ metabolism, and is regulated by phosphatidylinositol signaling.      In summary, these studies demonstrate altered genes expression in three SAMP8 hippocampal pathways associated with memory formation and consolidation.      These pathways may provide new therapeutic targets in addition to targeting Aβ metabolism itself.     Global differential profiling of hippocampal gene expression (4 month and 12 month old SAMP8 and Control mice) was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip® Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays.      At 12 months, but not at 4 months, pathway analysis revealed significant differences in the Long Term Potentiation (LTP) (6 genes), Phosphatidylinositol Signaling (6 genes), and Endocytosis (10 genes) pathways.      The changes in LTP included MAPK signaling (N-ras, CREB binding protein, protein phosphatase inhibitor 1) and Ca-dependent signaling (PI receptors 1 and 2 and phospholipase C).  Changes in phosphatidylinositol signaling genes suggested altered signaling through PI3-kinase, and Western blotting revealed phosphorylation changes in AKT and 70S6K.  Changes in the Endocytosis pathway involved genes related to clathrin-mediated endocytosis (dynamin and clathrin).  Endocytosis is required for receptor recycling, is involved in Aβ metabolism, and is regulated by phosphatidylinositol signaling.      In summary, these studies demonstrate altered genes expression in three SAMP8 hippocampal pathways associated with memory formation and consolidation.      These pathways may provide new therapeutic targets in addition to targeting Aβ metabolism itself.     2-way ANOVA (2 x 2 conditions, n=4).  First variable was age (4 and 12 months) and second variable was mouse strain (Control and SAMP8).  This results in 4 groups: Control-4 month, Control-12 month, SAMP8-4 month, and SAMP8-12 month.       Each group had 4 biological replicates (4 mice).  The ”Control” mice were a 50% backcross of the SAMP8 mice with CD-1 mice (50% SAMP8 mice).  These mice were closely related to SAMP8 mice but exhibited no memory deficits at 4 or 12 months.      The SAMP8 mice had memory deficits at 12 months but not at 4 months.
 E-GEOD-19707 - Expression data from Th2 cell of ECM1 KO mice vs WT mice CD4+ helper T cells are critical for immunological response.     Th2 cells, a subset of CD4+ helper T cells, are responsible for asthma and other immune diseases.     We found a Th2 secreted protein, ExtraCellular Matrix protein 1 (ECM1), which is highly induced by classic IL-4 signaling pathway during helper T cells differentiation.     We used microarrays to clarify the global programme of gene expression difference underlying fully developed Th2 cells from WT and ECM1 KO mice and identified distinct classes of up and down regulated genes by ECM1. Naïve CD4+ T cells are seperated from WT and ECM1 mice, cultured and harveseted for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
 E-GEOD-43991 - Differentially expressed genes between oncogene-transformed and non-transformed fetal liver progenitor cells The activation of different oncogenic signals may primarily contribute to the heterogeneity of cancer cells.     However, the exact mechanisms underlying different oncogenic transformation are still unclear.     We used the c-Myc, H-Ras and Akt transformed liver cell model to define mRNA expression profiles in the non-transformed and the three types of oncogene-transformed cells Purified p53-/- mouse fetal liver progenitor cells were transformed by three oncogenic genetic factors, c-Myc, H-RasV12 and myristoylated-AKT1(myr-Akt). The gene expression profilings of transformed cells and control cells were analyzed through microarray.
 E-GEOD-5496 - Transcription profiling of livers from mice overexpress ABCA1 in LDL receptor -/- genetic background to characterize the effects of ABCA1 overexpression. Changes in the transcript profile due to ABCA1 expression in murine liver samples was evaluated in LDL receptor -/- genetic backgrounds.     Experiment Overall Design: Case (ABCA1-transgenic) versus control (wild-type) design with 4 biological replicates per condition
 E-GEOD-15349 - Transcription profiling of mouse skeletal muscle gene expression after myostatin knockout in mature animals RNA from 5 mice with postdevelopmental knockout of myostatin and 5 mice with normal myostatin expression was analyzed with comprehensive oligonucleotide microarrays.     Myostatin depletion affected the expression of several hundred genes at nominal P   0.01, but fewer than a hundred effects were statistically significant according to a more stringent criterion (false discovery rate   5%). Most of the effects were less than 1.5-fold in magnitude.     In contrast to previously-reported effects of constitutive myostatin knockout, postdevelopmental knockout did not downregulate expression of genes encoding slow isoforms of contractile proteins or genes encoding proteins involved in energy metabolism.     Several collagen genes were expressed at lower levels in the myostatin-deficient muscles, and this led to reduced tissue collagen levels as reflected by hydroxyproline content.     Myostatin knockout tended to down-regulate the expression of sets of genes with promoter motifs for Smad3, Smad4, myogenin, NF-κB, serum response factor, and numerous other transcription factors.     Main conclusions: in mature muscle, myostatin is a key transcriptional regulator of collagen genes, but not genes encoding contractile proteins or genes encoding proteins involved in energy metabolism.     Experiment Overall Design: Comparison of muscle gene expression in 5 mice with postdevelopmental myostatin knockout and 5 control mice
 E-MEXP-710 - Transcription profiling by array of human cholinergic SN56.B5.G4 cells after treatment with beta-amyloid or hydrogen peroxide Effect of beta-Amyloid and oxidative stress on gene expression in cholinergic SN56.B5.G4-cells
 E-GEOD-35338 - Expression data from reactive astrocytes acutely purified from young adult mouse brains Reactive astrogliosis is characterized by a profound change in astrocyte phenotype in response to all CNS injuries and diseases.     To better understand the reactive astrocyte state, we used Affymetrix GeneChip arrays to profile gene expression in populations of reactive astrocytes isolated at various time points after induction using two different mouse injury models, ischemic stroke and neuroinflammation.     Young adult male mice underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) to produce ischemic stroke or control sham surgery.     Young adult mice were injected intraperitoneally with 5 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to produce neuroinflammation or saline for control.     Astrocytes were acutely purified from control and injured brains at 1 day after injury for LPS/saline injection and 1, 3 days and 7 days after MCAO/sham surgeries.
 E-GEOD-56483 - Modeling the clinical phenotype of BTK inhibition in the mature murine immune system Using the novel BTK inhibitor PF-303, we model the clinical phenotype of BTK inhibition by systematically examining the impact of PF-303 on the mature immune system in mice autoimmune indications.     However, our current knowledge of the role of BTK in immune competence has been gathered in the context of genetic inactivation of btk in both mice and man.     Using the novel BTK inhibitor PF-303, we model the clinical phenotype of BTK inhibition by systematically examining the impact of PF-303 on the mature immune system in mice.     We implicate BTK in tonic BCR signaling, demonstrate dependence of the T3 B cell subset and IgM surface expression on BTK activity, and find that B1 cells survive and function independently of BTK. While BTK inhibition does not impact humoral memory survival, antigen-driven clonal expansion of memory B cells and antibody secreting cell generation are inhibited.     These data define the role of BTK in the mature immune system and mechanistically predict the clinical phenotype of BTK inhibition.     We used Affymetrix genechips to profile the transcriptional changes downstream of BTK inhibition after in vivo B-cell activation by anti-IgD Mice were injected with the novel BTK inhibitor PF-303 2 hours prior to anti-IgD mediated in vivo B-cell activation; B-cells where harvested 2 hours after anti-IgD activation and RNA isolated.
 E-GEOD-5298 - Transcription profiling of mouse Tie2-Cre transgene endothelial cells with inactivated Gata4 reveals development of heart valves requires Gata4 expression in endothelial-derived cells Cardiac malformations due to aberrant development of the atrioventricular (AV) valves are among the most common forms of congenital heart disease.     At localized swellings of extracellular matrix known as the endocardial cushions, the endothelial lining of the heart undergoes an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) to form mesenchymal progenitors of the AV valves.     Further growth and differentiation of these mesenchymal precursors results in formation of portions of the atrial and ventricular septae, and generation of thin, pliable valves.     The transcription factor Gata4 is expressed in the endothelium and mesenchyme of the AV valves.     Using a Tie2-Cre transgene, we selectively inactivated Gata4 within endothelial-derived cells.     Mutant endothelium failed to undergo EMT, resulting in hypocellular cushions.     Mutant cushions had decreased levels of Erbb3, an EGF-family receptor essential for EMT in the atrioventricular cushions.     In Gata4 mutant embryos, Erbb3 downregulation was associated with impaired activation of Erk, which is also required for EMT. Expression of a Gata4 mutant protein defective in interaction with Friend of Gata (FOG) cofactors rescued the EMT defect, but resulted in decreased proliferation of mesenchyme and hypoplastic cushions that failed to septate the ventricular inlet.     We demonstrate two novel functions of Gata4 in development of the AV valves.     First, Gata4 functions as an upstream regulator of an Erbb3-Erk pathway necessary for EMT, and second, Gata4 acts to promote cushion mesenchyme growth and remodeling.     Experiment Overall Design: To further investigate the role of Gata4 in EC development, we specifically inactivated Gata4 in endothelium and endothelium-derived cushion mesenchyme.     All mice were maintained in a mixed C57BL6/129 genetic background.     Gata4wt/flox; T2Cre+ mice were crossed with Gata4flox/flox mice to yield Gata4flox/flox (CONTROL); T2Cre+ (Gata4T2del) (MUTANT) mice.
 E-GEOD-10913 - Transcription profiling of mouse  uterus reveals Bmp2 IS critical FOR THE murine decidual response The role of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (Bmp2)in regulating the transformation of the uterine stroma during embryo implantation in the mouse was investigated by the conditional ablation of Bmp2 in the uterus using the (PR-cre) mouse.     Experiment Overall Design: Bmp2 gene ablation was confirmed by real-time PCR analysis in the PR-cre; Bmp2fl/fl (termed Bmp2d/d) uterus.     While littermate controls average 0.9 litter of 6.2 ± 0.7 pups per month, Bmp2d/d females are completely infertile.     Analysis of the infertility indicates that whereas embryo attachment is normal in the Bmp2d/d as in control mice, the uterine stroma is incapable of undergoing the decidual reaction to support further embryonic development.     Recombinant human BMP2 can partially rescue the decidual response, suggesting that the observed phenotypes are not due to a developmental consequence of Bmp2 ablation.     Microarray analysis demonstrates that ablation of Bmp2 leads to specific gene changes, including disruption of the Wnt signaling pathway, Progesterone receptor (PR) signaling, and the induction of prostaglandin synthase 2 (Ptgs2). Taken together, these data demonstrate that Bmp2 is a critical regulator of gene expression and function in the murine uterus.
 E-GEOD-19091 - Transcriptional profiling of MKK4-depleted cells Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4) is a dual-specificity kinase activated by environmental stress, cytokines, and peptide growth factors that reportedly can promote or inhibit tumor cell growth and metastasis.     Somatic mutations in the gene encoding MKK4 (MAP2K4) have been identified in various human cancers, but the consequences of these mutations on MKK4 function and the biology of tumor cells that have them have not been elucidated.     Here we report that, of the eleven mutations within the MAP2K kinase domain described thus far, one had gain-of-function (Q142L) and six had loss-of-function.     Three of the loss-of-function mutations are nonsense mutations that produced C-terminally-truncated proteins (I295fs 23, R304 , and W310 ) that were highly ubiqitinated and rapidly degraded when introduced into cells, and three are missense mutations in the ATP-binding pocket (N234I), activation loop (S251N), or C-lobe (P326L). We modeled the consequences of MAP2K4 loss-of-function mutations on cells by introducing MKK4 short-hairpin RNA constructs and found that MKK4 depletion enhanced the ability of a weakly tumorigenic murine cancer cell to metastasize when injected into syngeneic mice but had no effect on primary tumor formation.     MKK4-depleted cells exhibited an increased capacity to migrate across PET filters and to invade through matrigel but no change in anchorage-dependent or -independent proliferation.     Transcriptional profiling of these cells revealed gene expression changes that promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis.     We conclude that MKK4 inactivation promoted metastasis but not primary tumor formation.     Collectively, these findings implicate loss-of-function MAP2K4 somatic mutations in tumor metastasis and provide one of the few examples of a somatic mutation in cancer cells that exerts a metastasis-specific effect.      Keywords: Two-group comparison.     393P cells were infected with retroviruses expressing a MKK4-specific shRNA construct (shZ) or scrambled control (scr). 393P-shZ and 393P-scr were transcriptionally profiled in triplicate cultures.
 E-GEOD-46892 - Generating mouse model with predominant naïve or innate memory phenotype CD4+ T cells Innate memory phenotype (IMP) CD4+ T cells are non-conventional αβ T cells exhibiting features of innate immune cells, characterized as CD44high and CD62Llow in periphery.     It is recently reported by our group that bone marrow chimeric mice lacking thymic MHCI expression develop predominantly IMP CD8+ T cells, while those lacking hematopoietic MHCI develop predominantly naïve CD8+ T cells.     Here we perform hirarchical clustering analysis and found that CD4+ T cells share similar property: chimeras lacking thymic MHCII gave rise to predominantly CD4+ T cells that resemble IMP CD4+ T cells observed in WT mice, and vice versa, chimeras lacking hematopoietic MHCII had a majority of naïve-like CD4+ T cells resembling naïveCD4+ T cells seen in WT mice.     We used microarrays to compare the global programme of gene expression to determine whether the hematopoietic MHCII selected CD4+ T cells are IMP, and whether the thymic MHCII selected CD4+ T cells are naïve CD4+ T cells as observed in WT mice.     Through hierarchical clustering and analysis of global gene differential expression, we determined that hematopoietic MHCII dependent IMP CD4+ T cells generated from WT bone marrow transplanted into irradiated MHCII-/- recipients, resemble IMP CD4+ T cells in WT mice, while naïve CD4+ T cells generated from MHCII-/- bone marrow transplanted into irradiated WT recipients, resemble naïve CD4+ T cells in WT mice.     Cell Sorting was performed using a Cytopeia Influx Cell Sorter.     Chimeric IMP (CD45.1+TCRβ+CD4+CD44highCD62Llow) CD4+ T cells were sorted from splenocytes of CD45.1+WT→CD45.2+MHCII-/- chimeras (WM IMP CD4), and chimeric naïve (CD45.2+TCRβ+CD4+CD44lowCD62Lhigh) CD4+ T cells were sorted from splenocytes of CD45.2+MHCII-/- → CD45.1+WT chimeras (MW naïve CD4) respectively, 8 weeks post transplantation.      WT IMP (TCRβ+CD4+CD44highCD62Llow) and naïve (TCRβ+CD4+CD44lowCD62Lhigh) CD4+ T cells were sorted from splenocytes of 8-week old WT mice.
 E-GEOD-26771 - Expression data from primary mammary epithelial cells expressing ectopic p190B RhoGAP P190B RhoGAP is required for mammary gland development, and its overexpression disrupts mammary gland branching morphogenesis.      To better understand the mechanisms by which p190B regulates mammary gland development we performed gene expression microarray analysis on mammary epithelial cells isolated from p190B overexpressing transgenic mice compared to control mice.     The mice used in this study were previously developed to inducibly overexpress p190B selectively in the mammary gland (Vargo-Gogola 2006). FVB/N mice carrying the MMTV-rtTA and TetO-p190B-IRES-luciferase transgenes or the MMTV-rtTA transgene only (Gunther EJ, FASEB) were fed doxycycline (Dox) chow (2 g/kg) for 7 d prior to removal of mammary glands and isolation of primary mammary epithelial cells at 6 weeks of age.
 E-GEOD-51108 - Gene expression in liver tissue from Ghrh-KO and normal (wild-type) mice The hypothalamus has recently emerged as a key regulator of metabolism and aging in mammals.     We have examined the impact of targeted disruption of hypothalamic hypophysiotropic peptide: Growth Hormone-releasing Hormone (GHRH) in mice on longevity, and the putative mechanisms of delayed aging.     GHRH knockout (KO) mice are remarkably long-lived and in comparison to genetically normal (wild type) animals exhibiting major shifts in the expression of genes related to xenobiotic detoxification, stress resistance, and insulin signaling.     These mutant mice also have increased adiponectin levels and alterations in glucose homeostasis consistent with the removal of the counter-insulin effects of GH. While these effects overlap with those of caloric restriction (CR), we show that effects of CR and the GHRH mutation are additive, with lifespan of GHRH-KO mutants further increased by CR. We conclude that GHRH-KO mice feature perturbations in a network of signaling pathways related to stress resistance, metabolic control and inflammation, and therefore provide a new model that can be used to explore links between GHRH repression, downregulation of the somatotropic axis, and extended longevity.     Hepatic tissue was obtained from 3 Ghrh-KO mice and 3 control (wild-type) mice (males). Expression in each sample was profiled using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays.
 E-TABM-661 - Transcription profiling of DBA/1J mouse with collagen induced arthritis Time course of collagen-induced arthritis in DBA/1J male mice, synchronized on day 28 with 10ug LPS
 E-GEOD-47606 - Changes in mouse kidney glomerular gene expression following dendrin  knockout Glomerular podocyte cells are critical for the function of the renal ultrafiltration barrier.     The highly specialized cell-cell junction of podocytes, the slit diaphragm, has a central role in the filtration barrier.     Dendrin is a poorly characterized cytosolic component of the slit diaphragm in where it interacts with nephrin and Cd2ap. In this study, we have generated a dendrin knockout mouse line and explored the molecular interactions of dendrin.     Dendrin-deficient mice were viable, fertile and had normal life span.     To reveal the glomerular gene expression changes in the dendrin knockout mouse, Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array were used to profiling the dendrin knockout and control glomeruli.     Three dendrin knockout and three littermate control mice at age of 13 months were used to profile glomerular transcriptomes.     Total glomerular RNA was extracted and hyrbridized on the Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array according to standard procedures.
 E-GEOD-4179 - Transcription profiling of mouse Foxp3-expressing regulatory T cells Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) expressing the forkhead family transcription factor Foxp3 are critical mediators of dominant immune tolerance to self.     Most Treg cells constitutively express the high-affinity interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor alpha-chain (CD25); however, the precise function of IL-2 in Treg cell biology has remained controversial.     To directly assess the effect of IL-2 signaling on Treg cell development and function, we analyzed mice containing the Foxp3gfp knock-in allele that were genetically deficient in either IL-2 (Il2-/-) or CD25 (Il2ra-/-). We found that IL-2 signaling was dispensable for the induction of Foxp3 expression in thymocytes from these mice, which indicated that IL-2 signaling does not have a nonredundant function in the development of Treg cells.     Unexpectedly, Il2-/- and Il2ra-/- Treg cells were fully able to suppress T cell proliferation in vitro.     In contrast, Foxp3 was not expressed in thymocytes or peripheral T cells from Il2rg-/- mice.     Gene expression analysis showed that IL-2 signaling was required for maintenance of the expression of genes involved in the regulation of cell growth and metabolism.     Thus, IL-2 signaling seems to be critically required for maintaining the homeostasis and competitive fitness of Treg cells in vivo.     Experiment Overall Design: We isolated Foxp3+ CD4+ T cells from Il2-/- mice treated with PBS or recombinant IL-2 for gene expression analysis using whole-genome oligonucleotide microarrays.     To identify gene expression changes resulting from IL-2 deficiency and subsequent IL-2 stimulation in Treg cells, we directly compared expression profiles with each other and with expression profiles of Foxp3+ CD4+ T cells isolated from wild-type mice.
 E-GEOD-51750 - Total lung gene expression data of Pneumocystis-infected wildtype and IFN-gamma knockout mice. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a disease of diverse etiology.     While primary PH can develop in the absence of prior disease, PH more commonly develops in conjunction with other pulmonary pathologies.     We previously reported a mouse model in which PH occurs as a sequelae of Pneumocystis infection in the context of transient CD4 depletion.     Here, we demonstrate that instead of the expected Th2 pathways, the Th1 cytokine IFN-γ was essential for the development of PH, as wild type mice developed PH, but not IFN-γ knockout mice.     Because gene expression analysis showed few strain differences that were not immune function related, we focused on those responses as potential pathologic mechanisms.     While there were several differences in cellular and cytokine response that warrant further examination, we focused on three important aspects.     First, if CD4 cells were continuously depleted, but the infection was limited by antibiotic treatment, then PH did not occur, confirming that CD4 T-cells are required for PH development.     Second, although CD8 T-cells are implicated in the pathology of unabated Pneumocystis pneumonia, they did not have a role in the onset of PH. Finally, although there are differences in the amounts of the pulmonary immune cells, differences existed in phenotypes of immune cells that correlated with PH, such as elevated CD204 expression in lung CD11c+ cells.     Two groups of BALB/c mice (3 per group) were infected i.t. with 10e7 Pneumocystis; one of those groups also received 4 injections of CD4 T-cell depleting antibodies beginning 3 days prior to infection and ending 7 days after infection.     A third group was IFN-gamma knockout mice infected with Pneumocystis and depleted of CD4 cells in the same way.     A fourth group of control non-treated BALB/c mice were also used.     AT 38 days post infection, lung tissues were taken, and RNA was extracted to allow for differential gene expression analysis
 E-GEOD-52644 - Nuclear receptor-mediated alleviation of alcoholic fatty liver by polyphenols contained in alcoholic beverages To elucidate the effect of the polyphenols contained in alcoholic beverages on the metabolic stress induced by ethanol consumption, four groups of mice were fed for five weeks on Lieber's diet with or without ethanol, with ethanol plus ellagic acid, and with ethanol plus trans-resveratrol.     Alcoholic fatty liver was observed in the group fed the ethanol diet but not in those fed the ethanol plus polyphenol diets.     Liver transcriptome analysis revealed that the addition of the polyphenols suppressed the expression of the genes related to cell stress that were up-regulated by ethanol alone.     Conversely, the polyphenols up-regulated the genes involved in bile acid synthesis, unsaturated fatty acid elongation, and tetrahydrofolate synthesis that were down-regulated by ethanol alone.     Because parts of these genes were known to be regulated by the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), we performed the same experiment in the CAR-deficient mice.     As a result, fatty liver was observed not only in the ethanol group but also with the ethanol plus polyphenol groups.     In addition, there was no segregation of the gene expression profiles among these groups.     These results provide a molecular basis for the prevention of alcohol-induced stress by the polyphenols in alcoholic beverages.     Five-week-old C3H/HeN female mice (CLEA, Japan) were acclimated to the maintenance condition (25°C, 8:00-20:00 day / 20:00-8:00 night cycle and 35~40 % humidity), fed a CE-2 diet (CLEA, Japan), and given water ad libitum for one week.     Each group of mice (n=4 for wild type mice analysis and n=3 for CAR decficient mice analysis) was fed Lieber's isocaloric diet (Oriental yeast, Japan) containing water, containing ethanol, containing ethanol and ellagic acid (Fluka Biochemika, Switzerland), or containing ethanol and trans-resveratrol (Sigma, USA) (Supplementary Table 1) for one week at 10:00 ad libitum.     Then, the mice were fed each diet at 12 g / day for four weeks (Supplementary Fig. 1A). The approximate intake of each polyphenol was 50 mg / kg body weight / day.     At 10:00 of the final day of the experimental period, the animals were anesthetized by diethyl ether, sacrificed by cervial fracture, and the heart blood, and the liver were collected.
 E-GEOD-8269 - Transcription profiling of mouse uterus from  gravidl d18 wild type vs. Cox-1 knockout animal Background:  Preterm birth is the leading cause of all infant mortality.      In 2004, 12.5% of all births were preterm.      In order to understand preterm labor, we must first understand normal labor.      Since many of the myometrial changes that occur during pregnancy are similar in mice and humans and mouse gestation is short, we have studied the uterine genes that change in the mouse during pregnancy.      Here, we used microarray analysis to identify uterine genes in the gravid mouse that are differentially regulated in the cyclooxygenase-1 knockout mouse model of delayed parturition.     Methods:  Gestational d18.0 uteri (n=4) were collected from pregnant wild-type and cyclooxygenase-1 knockout mice.      Part of the uterus was used for frozen sections and RNA was isolated from the remainder.      Microarray analysis was performed at the Indiana University School of Medicine Genomic Core and analyzed using the Microarray Data Portal.      Northern analysis was performed to confirm microarray data and the genes localized in the gravid uterus by in situ hybridization.     Results:  We identified 277 genes that are abnormally expressed in the gravid d18.0 cyclooxygenase-1 knockout mouse.      Nine of these genes are also regulated in the normal murine uterus during the last half of gestation.      Many of these genes are involved in the immune response, consistent with an important role of the immune system in parturition.      Expression of 4 of these genes; arginase I, IgJ, Tnfrsf9 and troponin; was confirmed by Northern analysis to be mis-regulated during pregnancy in the knockout mouse.      In situ hybridization of these genes demonstrated a similar location in the gravid wild-type and Cox-1 knockout mouse uteri.     Conclusions:  To our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the uterine location of these 4 genes in the mouse during late pregnancy.      There are several putative transcription factor binding sites that are shared by many of the 9 genes identified here including; estrogen and progesterone response elements and Ets binding sites.      In summary, this work identifies 9 uterine murine genes that may play a role in parturition.      The function of these genes is consistent with an important role of the immune system in parturition.     Experiment Overall Design: Gestational d18.0 uteri (n=4) were collected from pregnant wild-type and cyclooxygenase-1 knockout mice.      Part of the uterus was used for frozen sections and RNA was isolated from the remainder.      Microarray analysis (affymetrix 430 2.0) was performed at the Indiana University School of Medicine Genomic Core and analyzed using the Microarray Data Portal.      In order to reduce the number of candidate parturition-related genes identified we compared the genes identified as abnormally expressed in the Cox-1 KO uterus to the genes that we had previously identified as changing from gestational d13.5 to d19.0 in the wild-type mouse uterus.      Northern analysis was performed to confirm microarray data and the genes localized in the gravid uterus by in situ hybridization.
 E-GEOD-31431 - Serial gene expression profiling in the liver of Pdgf-c Tg mice that developed hepatic fibrosis and tumors Over expression of PDGF-C in mouse liver resulted in the progression of hepatic fibrosis, steatosis and the development of HCC; this mouse model closely resembles the human HCC that is frequently associated with hepatic fibrosis.     Peretinoin (generic name; code, NIK-333), developed by the Kowa Company, (Tokyo, Japan), is an oral acyclic retinoid (ACR) with a vitamin A-like structure that targets the retinoid nuclear receptor.     Peretinoin effectively inhibits the progression of hepatic fibrosis and tumors in Pdgf-c Tg mice.     Gene expression profiling was evaluated during the progression of hepatic fibrosis and tumors.     After weaning at week 4, Pdgf-c Tg or non-transgenic WT mice were fed a basal diet or a diet containing+0.06% peretinoin respectively.     At week 20, mice were sacrificed for the analysis of progression of hepatic fibrosis.     At week 48, mice were sacrificed for the analysis of the development of hepatic tumors.
 E-MTAB-1559 - Comparative genomic hybridization by array of male mouse liver cells to investigate copy number status Comparison of the genomic copy number status of livers from wildtype mice (reference) with Tak1/Casp8 knockout mice or Tak1/LPC knockout mice or Tak1/LPC/RIP3 knockout mice.
 E-GEOD-15433 - Transcription profiling of human NIH-3T3 fibroblasts stably expressing the coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CARI?1)) cells were transduced with adenovirus containing empty vector (AdEmpty) followed by addition of vehicle (DMSO) or transduced with adenovirus encoding either full length HA-tagged PPARg2 or A/B-domain deleted HA-PPARgCDE and treated with rosiglitazoneNIH-3T3 fibroblasts stably expressing the coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CARI?1)) cells were transduced with adenovirus containing empty vector (AdEmpty) followed by addition of vehicle (DMSO) or transduced with adenovirus encoding either full length HA-tagged PPARg2 or A/B-domain deleted HA-PPARgCDE and treated with rosiglitazone reveals the PPARg2 A/B-domain plays a gene specific role in transactivation and co-factor recruitment We have previously shown that adenoviral expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) leads to rapid establishment of transcriptionally active complexes and activation of target gene expression within 5-8 h following transduction.     Here we have used the adenoviral delivery system combined with expression array analysis to identify novel putative PPARgamma target genes in murine fibroblasts and to determine the role of the A/B-domain in PPARgamma mediated transactivation of genomic target genes.     Of the 257 genes found to be induced by PPARgamma2 expression, only 25 displayed A/B-domain dependency, i.e. significantly reduced induction in the cells expressing the truncated PPARgamma lacking the A/B-domain (PPARgammaCDE). Nine of the 25 A/B-domain dependent genes were involved in lipid storage and in line with this, triglyceride accumulation was considerably decreased in the cells expressing PPARgammaCDE compared to cells expressing full length PPARgamma2. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) we demonstrate that PPARgamma binding to genomic target sites and recruitment of the mediator component TRAP220/MED1/PBP/DRIP205 is not affected by the deletion of the A/B-domain.     By contrast, the PPARgamma-mediated CBP and p300 recruitment to A/B-domain dependent target genes is abolished by deletion of the A/B-domain.     These results indicate that the A/B-domain of PPARgamma2 is specifically involved in the recruitment or stabilization of CBP and p300 containing co-factor complexes to a subset of target genes.     Experiment Overall Design: Total RNA samples were obtained from three individual experiments in which NIH-CAR (i.e. a clonal cell line of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts stably expressing the coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CARΔ1)) cells were transduced with adenovirus containing empty vector (AdEmpty) followed by addition of vehicle (DMSO) or transduced with adenovirus encoding either full length HA-tagged PPARg2 or A/B-domain deleted HA-PPARgCDE and treated with rosiglitazone.
 E-GEOD-18858 - Transcription profiling by array of Mus musculus liver tissue after exposure to various carcinogenic chemicals Two-year rodent bioassays play a central role in evaluating both the carcinogenic potential of a chemical and generating quantitative information on the dose-response behavior for chemical risk assessments.     The bioassays involved are expensive and time-consuming, requiring nearly lifetime exposures (two years) in mice and rats and costing $2 to $4 million per chemical.     Since there are approximately 80,000 chemicals registered for commercial use in the United States and 2,000 more are added each year, applying animal bioassays to all chemicals of concern is clearly impossible.     To efficiently and economically identify carcinogens prior to widespread use and human exposure, alternatives to the two-year rodent bioassay must be developed.     In this study, animals were exposed for 13 weeks to 10 chemicals that were positive for liver tumors in the two-year rodent bioassay, 14 chemicals that were negative for liver tumors, and two chemicals that produced an equivocal response.     Matched vehicle control groups were run concurrently with each chemical treatment.      Gene expression analysis was performed on the livers of the animals to assess the potential for identifying gene expression biomarkers and signaling pathways that can predict tumor formation in a two-year bioassay following a 13 week exposure.     Five-week-old female B6C3F1 mice were exposed for 13 weeks to 26 chemicals.     The chemical and dose information are provided with the individual sample annotations.     With each chemical treatment, a matched vehicle control group was run concurrently with the exposure.     A subset of five chemicals, methylene chloride, naphthalene, 1,2,3-trichloropropane, propylene glycol mono-t-butyl ether, and 1,4-dichlorobenzene, were performed in a five-point dose response with matched control groups.     The concentrations for these exposures overlapped those in the original cancer bioassay.     Gavage exposures were administered 5 days per week and feed exposures were provided 7 days per week.     For inhalation exposures, mice were exposed 6 hr per day, 5 days per week.     After 13 weeks, animals were euthanized and livers were collected.     The right, caudate and median liver lobes were minced together and used for microarray analysis.      Microarray analysis was performed on the livers of three to five mice per treatment group.
 E-GEOD-14458 - Transcription profiling of mouse 344SQ lung adenocarcinoma cells with high metastatic potential (syngeneic mouse model) The biologic basis for NSCLC metastasis is not well understood.     Here we addressed this deficiency by transcriptionally profiling tumors from a genetic mouse model of human lung adenocarcinoma that develops metastatic disease owing to the expression of K-rasG12D and p53R172H. As a tool to investigate the biologic basis for metastasis in this model and to query the roles of specific genes in this signature, we isolated adenocarcinoma cell lines from these mice and used them to develop a syngeneic tumor model in wild-type littermates.     Transcriptional profiling of the highly metastatic subcutaneous tumors revealed genes that regulate, among other processes, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and intra-tumoral inflammation and angiogenesis, whereas the non-metastatic tumors did not.     Experiment Overall Design: Cell lines from p53R172H∆g/+ K-rasLA1/+ mice were derived from tumor tissues removed at autopsy from two different mice (#344 and #393). The tissues were minced, placed in culture, and passed serially in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), which yielded mass populations of tumor cells derived from primary lung tumors (344P and 393P), mediastinal lymph nodes (344LN and 393LN), and a subcutaneous site (344SQ).  Syngeneic tumors were isolated, carefully dissected to remove the adjacent tissue, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80° until use.     Part of each dissected tumor was histologically evaluated by a board-certified pathologist.     Snap-frozen samples were processed and analyzed on Affymetrix Mouse Expression Array 430A 2.0 chips.     Experiment Overall Design: Expression profiling performed on 344SQ, 393P, and 393LN
 E-GEOD-11201 - Transcription profiling of mouse developing liver compared both to normal adult liver and non-hepatic embryonic tissues Understanding congenital liver disease requires elucidation of the signaling pathways and transcriptional events in the developing liver.      Comprehensive assessment of gene expression between 10.5 and 16.5 dpc in the developing mouse liver and comparison with adult liver and non-hepatic embryonic tissue was validated with real-time PCR and in situ hybridization.      The broad nature of the analysis provides insights into patterns of genetic control of hepatogenesis.      Pathways implicated in human disease are highly regulated at the transcriptional level.      Rather than activating or inhibiting a pathway or biological process by altering the expression of a single signaling molecule, transcriptional changes in large numbers of genes in a pathway or process are regulated in a coordinated manner.      For example, both TGF-beta and Notch signaling is inhibited during hepatogenesis not just by decreasing transcription of multiple pathway members, but also with a complementary increase in the transcription of a pathway inhibitor.      Similarly, genes related to specific biological processes exhibit strong temporal synchronization in which multiple members of the pathway have similar transcriptional regulation over time.      Global coordination of signaling or functional families at the transcriptional level may be a mechanism to produce robustness of the desired outcomes.     In addition, this comprehensive analysis provides a database for the further study of transcriptional events during liver development by identifying liver-specific, highly regulated genes.      Experiment Overall Design: In order to provide transcriptional profile of the developing liver compared both to normal adult liver and non-hepatic embryonic tissueswe performed high-density microarray analysis using Affymetrix MG 430 2.0 chips for embryonic liver samples at 10.5, 11.5, 12.5, 13.5, 14.5, and 16.5 days post conception (dpc), embryo-minus liver tissues at 10.5, 11.5, 12.5, and 14.5 dpc, and normal 10-week-old adult mouse liver.     Each sample consisted of at least five embryos.
 E-GEOD-26476 - Smooth muscle IL-4 receptor activation induces airway hyper-responsiveness Selective stimulation of IL-4 receptor on smooth muscle induces airway hyper-responsiveness in mice.      Abstract: Production of the cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 is increased in both human asthma and mouse asthma models and Stat6 activation by the common IL-4/IL-13R drives most mouse model pathophysiology, including airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). However, the precise cellular mechanisms through which IL-4Rα induces AHR remain unclear.     Overzealous bronchial smooth muscle constriction is thought to underlie AHR in human asthma, but the smooth muscle contribution to AHR has never been directly assessed.     Furthermore, differences in mouse vs. human airway anatomy and observations that selective IL-13 stimulation of Stat6 in airway epithelium induces murine AHR raise questions about the importance of direct IL-4R effects on smooth muscle in murine asthma models and relevance of these models to human asthma.     Using transgenic mice in which smooth muscle is the only cell type that expresses or fails to express IL-4Rα, we demonstrate that direct smooth muscle activation by IL-4, IL-13, or allergen is sufficient, but not necessary, to induce AHR and show that 5 genes known to promote smooth muscle migration, proliferation and contractility are activated by IL-13 in smooth muscle in vivo.      These observations demonstrate that IL-4Rα promotes AHR through multiple mechanisms and provide a model for testing smooth muscle-directed asthma therapeutics.     For the microarray aspect of of the study, there were three groups of mice: 1.   IL4R gene knockout (KO) mice 2.   WT mice 3.  IL4R KO mice that were also transgenic for a gene construct that expressed IL4R under the control  of the smooth muscle-specific promoter from the SMP8 gene  All mice were subjected to intratracheal IL13 exposure for 7 days, and whole lung RNA was prepared for microarray analysis 24 hours after the last instillation.      Per treatment and genotype: Two RNA pools were made from four mice each.      These were labeled and hybridized to make a total of 6 microarrays.      RNA was labeled with the standard Affymetrix 3' labeling protocol to make cDNA that was hybridized to Mouse MOE 430 plus 2.0 GeneChips.      Gene transcripts were identified that differed in their relative expression  as a function of IL4R expression on the smooth muscle cells.
 E-GEOD-44091 - Genome-wide expression of the epithelial layer cells of mice injected with Clostridium difficile Toxin A and B Toxin A (TcdA) and Toxin B (TcdB), of the pathogen Clostridium difficile, are virulence factors that cause gross pathologic changes (e.g. inflammation, secretion, and diarrhea) in the infected host, yet the molecular and cellular pathways leading to observed host responses are poorly understood.     To address this gap, TcdA and/or TcdB were injected into the ceca of mice and the genome-wide transcriptional response of epithelial layer cells was examined.     Bioinformatic analysis of gene expression identified sets of cooperatively expressed genes.     Further analysis of inflammation associated genes revealed dynamic chemokine responses.     In total, 32 samples were analyzed (one microarray per mouse). The sample groups are separated by two factors: Toxin (TcdA, TcdB, TcdA+TcdB, or Sham injection) and endpoint (2, 6, or 16h). TcdA+B at 16h was not included, leaving 11 sample groups.     Each sample group included biological triplicates, except TcdA+TcdB at 6h (one array) and Sham injection at 16h (four arrays).

 E-GEOD-47607 - Environmental factors transmitted by aryl hydrocarbon receptor influence severity of psoriatic skin inflammation [Affymetrix] Environmental stimuli are known to contribute to psoriasis pathogenesis and that of other autoimmune diseases, but the mechanism is unknown.     Here we show that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transcription factor that senses environmental stimuli, modulates pathology in psoriasis.     AhR-activating ligands reduced inflammation in the lesional skin of psoriasis patients, whereas AhR antagonists upregulated inflammation.     Similarly, AhR signaling via the endogenous FICZ ligand reduced the inflammatory response in the imiquimod-induced model of psoriasis and AhR deficient mice exhibited a substantial exacerbation of the disease, compared to AhR sufficient controls.     Non-haematopoietic cells, in particular keratinocytes, were responsible for this hyper-inflammatory response, which involved increased reactivity to IL-1beta and upregulation of AP-1 family members of transcription factors.     Thus, our data suggest a critical role for AhR in the regulation of inflammatory responses and open the possibility for novel therapeutic strategies in chronic inflammatory disorders.     Total RNA obtained from skin explants taken from AhR heterozygous or knock-out mice treated pericutaneously with imiquimod for 0 and 2d.
 E-GEOD-80633 - Gene expression analysis in cortex of CRTC1 deficient mice and WT littermates To identify gene expression changes associated with Crtc1 deficiency, we performed genome-wide transcriptome profile analyses by using mouse cDNA microarrays in the cortex of Crtc1‒/‒ and WT female mice BACKGROUND: Recent studies involve the arginine-decarboxylation product agmatine in mood regulation.     Agmatine has antidepressant properties in rodent models of depression, and agmatinase (Agmat), the agmatine-degrading enzyme, is upregulated in the brain of mood disorders patients.     We showed that mice lacking CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (CRTC1) associate neurobehavioral and molecular depressive-like endophenotypes, as well as blunted responses to classical antidepressants.      METHODS: The molecular basis of the behavioral phenotype of Crtc1‒/‒ mice was further examined using microarray analysis.     We characterized Agmat expression in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HIP) by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), Western blot (WB) analysis, and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy.     The antidepressant effect of agmatine was assessed by the forced swim test (FST). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) phosphorylation were measured by WB.  RESULTS: Microarray, qPCR and WB analyses revealed an upregulation of Agmat in Crtc1‒/‒ PFC and HIP, where immunofluorescence microscopy showed more Agmat-expressing cells, notably parvalbumin- and somatostatin-interneurons.     Acute agmatine treatment efficiently improved depressive-like behavior of Crtc1‒/‒ mice in the FST, suggesting that exogenous agmatine has a rapid antidepressant effect through the compensation of agmatine deficit induced by upregulated Agmat.     In WT mice, agmatine rapidly increased BDNF levels and eEF2 dephosphorylation, indicating that it might be a fast–acting antidepressant with NMDA receptor antagonist properties.      CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings support the involvement of the agmatinergic system in the depressive-like phenotype of Crtc1‒/‒ mice, and allow a better understanding of the agmatinergic system and its putative role in major depression.     RNA from cortex of 5 WT and 5 KO mice was used
 E-GEOD-28586 - Expression of Stem Cell Pluripotency genes in mASCs and ES, iPS, and mi-iPS cells Comparison of TaqMan Gene Signature Arrays (Mouse Stem Cell Pluripotency Array) was represented in mASCs and ES, iPS, and mi-iPS cells.     Comparison of TaqMan Gene Signature Arrays (Mouse Stem Cell Pluripotency Array) was represented in mASCs and ES, iPS, and mi-iPS cells.
 E-GEOD-34669 - Astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) promotes hepatocarcinogenesis: novel insights from a mouse model Astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) as a positive inducer of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Transgenic mice with hepatocyte-specific expression of AEG-1 were challenged with N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN) and developed multinodular HCC with steatotic features.     Thus, we have identified the follwoing AEG-1 functions: induction of steatosis, inhibition of senescence and activation of coagulation pathway to augment an aggressive hepatocarcinogenic phenotype.     Transgenic Mice liver tumors compared against WT mice liver tumors.
 E-GEOD-41164 - Expression data from splenic B-cells isolated from DmU50(HG-b) mice or wild-type C57BL/6J Box C/D-type small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are functional RNAs responsible for mediating 2’-O-ribose methylation of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) within the nucleolus.     Previously, in relation to a novel chromosomal translocation in a human B-cell lymphoma, we identified U50HG, a non-protein-coding gene that hosted a box C/D-type U50 snoRNA within its intron.     To investigate the physiological importance of the U50 snoRNA and its involvement in tumorigenesis, we generated a mouse model deficient in mouse U50 (mU50) snoRNA expression without altering the expression of mouse mU50 host-gene, mU50HG-b. The established mU50 snoRNA-deficient mice showed a significant reduction of mU50 snoRNA expression and the corresponding target rRNA methylation in various organs.     Lifelong phenotypic monitoring showed that the mU50-deficient mice looked almost normal without accelerated tumorigenicity; however, a notable difference was the propensity for anomalies in the lymphoid organs.     B-cells were isolated from spleens of DmU50(HG-b) mice or wild-type C57BL/6J with antibody-conjugated magnetic beads system (Myltenyi Biotec). Total RNA was purified with QIAGEN RNeasy Micro kit.     Affymetrix GeneChip® Microarrays (Mouse Expression 430 2.0 Array) were used.
 E-GEOD-46869 - Gene expression profiles of PIK3CA knockdown by shRNA in lung cancer cells To gain insight into EMT-independent biological processes through which PI3K promotes invasion, RNA samples from 344SQ p110α shRNA cells and 344SQ scr cells were subjected to global transcriptional profiling.     Two groups, control and PIK3CA shRNA, in 344SQ lung cancer cell line Two group comparison
 E-GEOD-49689 - A Mesodermal Factor, T (BRACHYURY), specifies mouse germ cell fate by directly activating germline determinants. The germ cell lineage ensures reproduction and heredity in metazoans.     Primordial germ cells (PGCs) in mice are induced in pluripotent epiblast cells by BMP4 and WNT3, yet their mechanism of action remains elusive.     Here, using in vitro PGC specification system, we show that WNT3, but not BMP4, induces many transcription factors associated with mesoderm in epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) through beta-CATENIN. Among these, T (BRACHYURY), a classical and conserved mesodermal factor, was essential for robust activation of Blimp1 and Prdm14, two of the germline determinants.     T, but not SMAD1 or beta-CATENIN/TCF1, binds distinct regulatory elements of both Blimp1 and Prdm14, and directly up-regulates these genes without BMP4 and WNT3. Without BMP4, a program induced by WNT3 prevents T from activating Blimp1 and Prdm14, demonstrating that BMP4 is permissive for PGC specification.     These findings establish a fundamental role of a mesodermal gene in PGC specification, a potentially evolutionarily conserved mechanism across metazoans.     Wnt3 (+/+) and Wnt3 (-/-) mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) bearing the BV transgenes expressing membrane-targeted Venus under the control of Blimp1 regulatory elements (Blimp1-mVenus: BV;  PMID 18583473) were established and maintained.     Epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) were then induced from the established ES lines, followed by the cytokine stimulation (No cytokines [negative control], BMP4, Wnt3a, BMP4+Wnt3a) for different periods (0h, 12h, 24h, 36h).
 E-GEOD-52243 - Identification of novel mechanosensitive genes differentially regulated at 48 h timepoint in vivo using mouse carotid   artery endothelium exposed to disturbed blood flow Recently, we showed that disturbed ﬂow caused by a partial ligation ofmouse carotid artery rapidly induces atherosclerosis.     Analysis of mechanosenstive microRNA in the mouse carotid endothelium.      In this study, we examined the microRNAs that respond differentially to blood flow pattern in the mouse carotid endothelium.      We surgically induced disturbed blood flow in the left common carotid cartery (LCA) using partial carotid ligation surgery while the right carotid artery was left undisturbed.      The hypothesis tested here is that turbulent or disturbed blood flow across the left carotid artery endothelium will affect endothelial genes and microRNAS.  Identifying flow-sensitive microRNAs will provide important information about how endothelium responds to d-flow and regulates endothelial function and progression of atherosclerosis.     Deter-  mining the functional importance of these novel mechanosensitive microRNAS may provide important insights into understanding vascular biology and atherosclerosis.     We used 6- to 8-week-old male C57Bl/6 mice (The Jackson Laboratory) according to the approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol by Emory University.     Mice were subjected to partial carotid ligation surgery under anesthesia.      Brieﬂy, 3 of 4 caudal branches of LCA (left external carotid, internal carotid, and occipital artery) were ligated with 6-0 silk suture, although the superior thyroid artery was left intact.     Development of low and oscillatory blood flow in the Left Carotid Artery of each mouse was determined by ultrasound measurements.
 E-GEOD-8322 - Transcription profiling of  transgenic AFT6-MER mice treated WITH tamoxifen vs controls identifies  OF MCIP1 AS an ATF6-inducible ER Stress Response Gene We recently found that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response (ERSR) is activated in surviving cardiac myocytes in a mouse model of in vivo myocardial infarction.      ATF6 is an ER stress-activated transcription factor that induces ERSR genes, some of which encode proteins that may protect against ischemic damage.      However, few ERSR genes have been identified in the heart, and there have been no gene expression profiling studies of ATF6-inducible genes, in vivo.      We previously generated transgenic (TG) mice that express tamoxifen-activated ATF6, ATF6-MER, in the heart; ATF6-MER conferred tamoxifen-dependent ATF6 activation and protection from ischemic damage.      To understand of the mechanism of ATF6-mediated cardioprotection, gene expression profiling of ATF6-MER TG mouse hearts was performed.      Activated ATF6 changed expression levels of 1,162 genes in the heart; of the 775 ATF6-inducible genes, only 23 are known ERSR genes.      One of the genes not expected to be induced by ATF6 is modulatory calcinuerin-interacting protein-1 (MCIP1).  MCIP1 is induced in a calcineurin/NFAT-dependent manner during myocardial hypertrophy and it can feedback inhibit cardiomyocyte growth.      We found that MCIP1 expression in cultured cardiomyocytes was increased by the prototypical ER stresser, tunicamycin (TM), or by simulated ischemia.      Moreover, infecting cardiomyocytes with adenovirus encoding activated ATF6 induced MCIP1 expression and inhibited myocyte growth in response to the -adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine.      These results suggest that MCIP1 can be induced in the heart by ER stresses, such as ischemia.      Moreover, b integrating hypertrophy and ER stress, MCIP-modulated myocyte growth may help rejuvenate nascent ER protein folding, which could contribute to protection from ischemic damage.     Experiment Overall Design: 12 mice were analyzed in this study.     Four treatment groups were included in this study: transgenic ATF6-MER mice treated with tamoxifen, transgenic ATF6-MER mice treated with vehicle, nontransgenic littermates treated with tamoxifen, and nontransgenic littermates treated with vehicle.     Each treatment group included 3 separate biological replicate samples.     Each mouse sampled was male, C57/BL6, ~30 weeks old.     Each mouse was treated, then the mouse was sacrificed, the heart was extracted, and left ventricle was isolated.     Total RNA was isolated from the left ventricle, and used for hybridization onto an Affymetrix mus 430 2.0 full-genome chip.     Each heart was hybridized onto its own chip.
 E-GEOD-8431 - Transcription profiling of mouse RARgamma responsive genes in F9 teratocarcinoma cells We compared the differentially expressed genes between the F9 Wt cells and F9 RAR gamma knock out cells before and after RA treatment.     3 replicates for each conditions.     We also identified the RA responsive genes in the F9 Wt cells.     Experiment Overall Design: F9 wt cells and F9 RAR gamma knock out cells are treated with RA (1 uM) or ethanol for 24 hours.     3 replicates for each condition.
 E-GEOD-15119 - Transcription profiling of moise mammary tumors in transgenic animals expressing constitutively active and C-terminally truncated variants of STAT5 Stat5 is a latent transcription factor that regulates essential growth and survival functions in normal cells.     Constitutive activity of Stat5 and the involvement of its C-terminally truncated variant have been implicated in blood cell malignancies and mammary or breast cancer.     To distinguish the individual contributions of the Stat5 variants to mammary tumorigenesis, global gene-expression profiling was performed on transgenic STAT5-induced tumors.     Experiment Overall Design: Mammary tumors derived from transgenic mice carrying one of two Stat5 variants were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix GeneChip® Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 array.
 E-GEOD-18534 - Transcription profiling by array of a mouse small cell lung cancer model A mouse model for human small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) has been developed based on evidence in human tumors that the tumor suppressor functions of RB and p53 are defective in more than 90% of SCLC cases.     We also developed another mouse model also combines loss of p130 (Rbl2), an RB-related gene, with deletion of RB and p53. These two mouse tumors were shown to closely resemble human SCLC.  The goal of this array experiment is to assess genome-wide gene expression of those mouse tumors and determine the similarity of the mouse models to human SCLC. Gene expression from Mouse Rb/p53 ( n=10 ) and Rb/p53/p130 primary tumors ( n=3 ) as well as tumor-free adult mouse lungs ( n=2 ) was measured using the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430-2.0 arrays.
 E-GEOD-51226 - MicroRNA transciptional profiling in murine abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) model - Day 7 We sought to identify differentially regulated microRNAs in infrarenal mouse aortic tissue after AAA-induction with PPE, compared with sham-operated mice.     This treatment leads to rapid development of infrarenal aortic aneurysms with significant diameter differences observed by Day 7. We found 41 miRNAs were up-regulated with aneurysm and 37 down-regulated at p 0.05, which were also altered by  1.5-fold.     Utilizing the PPE infusion model, we induced AAA in Male 10-week-old C57/Bl6 mice, 7 days after AAA-induction with PPE. One array per mouse, 5 mice per group, two groups (PPE and sham).
 E-GEOD-6496 - Ovalbumin sensitized and challenged induces differential gene expression in mouse lungs To gain insight into the promoting effect of ultrafine particle inhalation on development and progression of allergic asthma, we selected an experimental approach involving exposure to ultrafine carbon particles (UCP) and gene expression profiling of lungs from mice with experimental, ovalbumin induced allergy.     Comparative gene expression analysis was performed by hybridizing pooled cDNA samples from lavaged lungs of different groups.      These results suggest that allergic sensitization may represent a susceptibility factor for effects of UCP on gene expression in the lung.     In sensitized individuals UCP exposure, such as found in polluted air, thus may contribute to the development and /or aggravation of allergic asthma.     Keywords: Particle Inhalation, lung, ovalbumin sensitzed and challanged, experssion profiling Lungs of groups of six non-sensitized, ovalbumin sensitized, or sensitized and ovalbumin challenged BALB/cJ mice, either subjected to particle-free or UCP containing air; two replicates including one dye swap experiment have been performed for lungs: a) non-sensitized particle free air versus sensitized and ovalbumin challenged sensitized particle free air; b) non-sensitized UCP containing air versus sensitized and ovalbumin challenged sensitized UCP containing air
 E-MEXP-704 - Transcription profiling by array of mouse primary dermal fibroblasts after treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine Primary mouse dermal fibroblasts from heterozygous female X chromosome-linked GFP mice were sorted through FACS for GFP non-expressing cells (~50% of cells due to X-inactivation).  The GFP- cells were treated with 4uM 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5A2dC) for 48 hours with recovery in normal medium for 24 hours.      Following the treatment, cells were again sorted by FACS into GFP-activated and GFP-nonexpressing cells.      These populations, along with a control untreated population were assayed for transcriptional changes by microarray.
 E-TABM-212 - Transcription profiling of bone marrow derived cells from mice stimulated with RANKL to generate osteoclasts in a time series Bone marrow derived cells stimulated with RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand, also known as Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 11) to generate osteoclasts.
 E-GEOD-53307 - Expression data from multiple mouse adipose depots Comparing gene expression profiles of murine subcutaneous vs. visceral adipose tissue.     Gene expression was analyzed in two subcutaneous depots (inguinal and axillary) and two visceral depots (epididymal and mesenteric) from male C57Bl/6 mice.     4 samples were analyzed as two groups: inguinal and axillary (subcutaneous) and epididymal and mesenteric (visceral). Each sample was derived by pooling RNA from the relevant fat depot from 3 age-matched, male C57Bl6 mice.
 E-GEOD-55672 - Transcriptional analysis of live and hybridized iPSCs Mouse induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were derived from embryonic fibroblasts by overexpressing the Yamanaka factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc, and grown in standard 2i/serum media conditions.     Hybridized iPSCs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde; incubated for 12 hours at 30C in an RNA preserving hybridization buffer (300 mM Sodium chloride, 30mM Sodium citrate, 2.1M Ammonium sulfate, 25% formamide, 10 mM EDTA, 1 mg/ml E. Coli tRNA, 500 μg/ml BSA); and reverse cross-linked for 1 hour at 50C in with Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and Proteinase K (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM pH 8.0 Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 500 μg/ml Proteinase K).    RNA extracted from live and hybridized iPSCs (1 sample each) was compared by microarray.
 E-GEOD-22125 - Transcription profiling by array of pancreatic islets from pregnant mice During pregnancy, pancreatic islets undergo structural and functional changes that lead to enhance insulin release in response to increased insulin demand, which is rapidly reversed at parturition.     One of the most important changes is expansion of pancreatic β-cell mass mainly by increased proliferation of β cells.     We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression and identified distinct up- or down-regulated genes during pregnancy.     Maternal islet were isolated from mice at dpc 0 and 12.5 dpc of pregnancy for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.     We sought to identify the responsible factors for the proliferation of islets during pregnancy.
 E-GEOD-11808 - Transcription profiling of mouse liver from tumor bearing animals by TSU68 treatment The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of TSU68, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), on colon cancer liver metastasis and to test the hypothesis that TSU68 modulates the microenvironment in the liver before the formation of metastasis.      Experiment Overall Design: The human colon cancer TK-4 was implanted orthotopically into cecal walls of 6-week-old male BALB/c nu/nu mice (Clea Japan, Tokyo, Japan). The animals were treated with TSU68 (400 mg/kg/day, twice-daily, p.o.) or vehicle from 7 days after orthotopic implantation.     After one week of drug administration, livers were removed and total RNA was extracted.     Experiment Overall Design: We established four different groups of mice; non-tumor-bearing and treated with vehicle alone (NT-Co), non-tumor-bearing and treated with TSU68 (NT-TSU), tumor-bearing and treated with vehicle (T-Co), and tumor-bearing and treated with TSU68 (T-TSU). NT-Co, T-Co and T-TSU group were applied to microarray analysis.
 E-GEOD-61499 - Microarray analysis to evaluate the function of USP18 in the mouse CNS Microglia are tissue macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS) that control tissue homeostasis, and as such they are crucially important for organ integrity.     Microglia dysregulation is thought to be causal for a group of neuropsychiatric, neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases, called ‚Äòmicrogliopathies‚Äô. However, how the intracellular stimulation machinery in microglia is controlled is poorly understood.     By using expression studies, we identified the ubiquitin-specific protease (Usp) 18 in white matter microglia that essentially contributes to microglial quiescence under homeostatic conditions.     We further found that microglial Usp18 negatively regulated the activation of STAT1 and concomitant induction of interferon-induced genes thereby disabling the termination of IFN signalling.     Unexpectedly, the Usp18-mediated feedback loop was independent from the catalytic domain of the protease but instead required the interacting region of Ifnar2. Additionally, the absence of Ifnar1 completely rescued microglial activation indicating a tonic IFN signal mediated by receptor interactions under non-diseased conditions.     Finally, conditional depletion of Usp18 only in myeloid cells significantly enhanced the disease burden in a mouse model of CNS autoimmunity, increased axonal and myelin damage and determined the spatial distributions of CNS lesions that shared the same STAT1 signature as myeloid cells found in active multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions.     These results identify Usp18 as novel negative regulator of microglia activation, demonstrate a protective role of the IFNAR pathway for microglia and establish Usp18 as potential therapeutic target for the treatment of MS. Brain lysate of adult WT, USP18ko, IFNAR1ko and USP18ko:IFNARko mice were analyzed
 E-MTAB-598 - Gene expression in subcutaneous fat from DNA binding-dependent androgen receptor knockout male mice Gene expression profiles were examined in DNA binding-dependent androgen receptor knockout (DBD-ARKO) and WT male mice to identify genes regulated by the AR. DBD-ARKO mice have an in-frame deletion of exon 3 of the AR.
 E-GEOD-4258 - Transcription profiling of mouse POR-null and wild type jejunum response to quercetin Using mice deficient in hepatic cytochrome-P450 oxidoreductase (POR), which disables the liver cytochrome P450 system, the metabolism and biological response of the anti-carcinogenic flavonoid, quercetin, was examined.     Profiling circulating metabolites revealed similar profiles over 72 h in wild type (WT) and POR-null (KO) mice, showing that hepatic P450 and reduced biliary secretion do not affect quercetin metabolism.     Transcriptional profiling at 24 h revealed that 2-3 fold more genes responded significantly to quercetin in WT compared to KO in the jejunum, ileum, colon, and liver, suggesting that hepatic P450s mediate many of the biological effects of quercetin, such as immune function, estrogen receptor signaling and lipid, glutathione, purine, and amino acid metabolism, even though quercetin metabolism is not modified.     The functional interpretation of expression data in response to quercetin (single dose of 7 mg/animal) revealed a molecular relationship between the liver and jejunum.     In WT animals, amino acid and sterol metabolism were predominantly modulated in the liver, fatty acid metabolism response was shared between the liver and jejunum, and glutathione metabolism was modulated in the small intestine.     In contrast, KO animals do not regulate amino acid metabolism in the liver or small intestine, they share the control of fatty acid metabolism between the liver and jejunum, and regulation of sterol metabolism is shifted from the liver to the jejunum and that of glutathione metabolism from the jejunum to the liver.      This demonstrates that the quercetin-mediated regulation of these biological functions in extrahepatic tissues is dependent on the functionality of the liver POR. In conclusion, using a systems biology approach to explore the contribution of hepatic phase I detoxification on quercetin metabolism demonstrated the resiliency and adaptive capacity of a biological organism in dealing with a bioactive nutrient when faced with a tissue-specific molecular dysfunction.     Experiment Overall Design: All animals were adapted to the RM3 (E) 801710 Soya-free powdered diet (B. S & S. [Scotland] Ltd, UK) over a period of 14 days.     Quercetin was added separately to the semi-purified diets at a concentration of 6200 ppm (0.62 %; 6.2 g per kg). 65 male cytochrome P450 reductase null (KO) mice and 65 wild type (WT) C57BL/6 mice were reared, all aged between 6-8 weeks.     Animals were housed 3 per cage, where both temperature and relative humidity were maintained within a range of 19-23oC and 40-70%, respectively.     Twelve-hour periods of light were cycled with twelve-hour periods of darkness.       Experiment Overall Design: For each strain of mouse, the following experimental design was used: a control group (25 mice) receiving powdered RM3 diet ad libitum and a group (25 mice) receiving a ‘high dose’ of quercetin (7 mg / mouse). The experimental diet was administered on day 15, following a 14-day adaptation period to the RM3 diet.     Animals were sacrificed after 24 h. Experiment Overall Design: RNA samples destined for microarray analysis were only accepted and pooled into three groups if no aberrant signs of degradation (e.g. multiple peaks) were observed.     The comprehensive gene expression profiles of the liver, jejunum, ileum, and colon were analyzed.     In all cases, except those listed, RNA from 3 mice was pooled to form sample 1, another 3 mice to form sample 2, etc.     Thus, 9 mice were used for the four experimental groups: wild-type, wild-type+quercetin, POR-null, POR-null+quercetin.
 E-GEOD-28408 - Expression data from Ly6G+ and Ly6G- dendritic cells (DC) To investigate the functional properties of Ly6G+ DC,  we employed GeneChip analysis to compare the gene expression profiles between Ly6G+ DC and Ly6C- DC. Crude bone marrow (BM) cells prepared from C57BL/6 mice were cultured in the presence of GM-CSF. On day 6, CD11c+/MHC II+/Ly6G+ cells and CD11c+/MHC II+/Ly6G- cells were simultaneously sorted from the same cultures by FACSAria.     Total RNA were extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
 E-GEOD-84767 - Genetics of the hippocampal transcriptome in mouse: a systematic survey and online neurogenomics resource The Hippocampus Consortium data set provides estimates of mRNA expression in the adult hippocampus of 99 genetically diverse strains of mice including 67 BXD recombinant inbred strains, 13 CXB recombinant inbred strains, a diverse set of common inbred strains, and two reciprocal F1 hybrids.     The hippocampus is an important and intriguing part of the forebrain that is crucial in memory formation and retrieval, and that is often affected in epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia.     Unlike most other parts of the brain, the hippocampus contains a remarkable population of stems cells that continue to generate neurons and glial cells even in adult mammals (Kempermann, 2005). This genetic analysis of transcript expression in the hippocampus (dentate gyrus, CA1-CA3) is a joint effort of 14 investigators that is supported by numerous agencies described in the acknowledgments section.     Pooled RNA samples (usually one pool of male hippocampii and one pool of female hippocampii) were prepared using standard protocols.     Samples were processed using a total of 206 Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Expression 430 2.0 short oligomer arrays (MOE430 2.0 or M430v2; see GEO platform ID GPL1261), of which 201 passed quality control and error checking.     This particular data set was processed using the PDNN protocol.     To simplify comparisons among transforms, PDNN values of each array were adjusted to an average of 8 units and a standard deviation of 2 units.
 E-GEOD-11843 - RNA binding of mouse retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in multiple sclerosis and in glaucoma eyes compared to normal controls to identify RNA species bound by deiminated and non-deiminated MA-Brent-1 (bhatt-affy-mouse-581641) We have identified loss of deiminated MA-Brent-1 (an RNA and export binding protein) in the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in multiple sclerosis and in glaucoma eyes compared to normal controls.     Deimination refers to posttranslational modification of protein bound arginine (not free arginine) in citrulline.     Our preliminary studies suggest binding of different repertoire of RNA by non-deiminated and deiminated MA-Brent-1. In vitro, in neurites of cultured RGCs and hippocampal neurons, the select mRNA translation is enhanced by addition of deiminated but not non-deiminated MA-Brent-1. These observations suggest that lack of deiminated MA-Brent-1 has consequences for protein synthesis, remodeling and plasticity of RGCs/neurons.     Identification of RNA species bound by deiminated and non-deiminated MA-Brent-1 will enable us there further verification and determining the role that deimination plays in biological function of MA-Brent-1 in multiple sclerosis and glaucoma.     To summarize identification of RNA species bound by deiminated and non deiminated MA-Brent-1 will enable us to gain further insight into role of deimination in the overall disease process.     To identify the RNA species bound by deiminated and non-deiminated MA-Brent-1; The deiminanted MA-Brent-1 binds to a different repertoire of RNA and non-deiminated MA-Brent-1. Corollary to this hypothesis is that the deiminated MA-Brent-1 enhances translation for bound species of RNA. Loss of deimination results in less dendritic protein synthesis and has consequences for remodeling and plasticity in multiple sclerosis and glaucoma RGCs where lack of deimination (compared to control eyes) has been observed.     About 10 microgram of purified recombinant and his-tagged non-deiminated MA-Brent-1 or deiminated MA-Brent-1 will be incubated with about 400 microgram of total RNA. The RNA bound his-tagged protein will be incubated with about 100 microliters of Ni-NTA beads and loaded onto a mini column.     The column will be washed with 50 volumes of binding buffer.     The bound his-tagged protein will be released using 100 mM immidazole in the binding buffer.     The MA-Brent-1 bound RNA will be recovered by boiling the protein in 0.25% SDS followed by purification of RNA using columns or using a 4% PAGE-0.8% agarose composite gel followed by gel purification.     The composite gel RNA purification is routine practice in the laboratory.     RNA binding experiment for each protein variant (deiminated or non-deiminated) MA-Brent-1 will be repeated twice.     Identified RNA species common in both binding experiments for a given species will be candidates for further pursuit.     The recombinant purified MA-Brent-1 will be subjected to deimination by incubating with recombinant peptidylarginine deiminase type II (PAD2). PAD2 is a C-terminus GST tag fusion protein and will be purified using GST column.     Deiminated and non-deiminated MA-Brent-1, C-terminal his-tag fusion proteins will be purified using Ni-NTA beads/column and immidazole containing buffer as eluents.     Experiment Overall Design: in vitro RNA binding with deiminated and non-deiminated MA-Brent-1
 E-GEOD-37294 - Comparison of gene expression in NOD versus NOD.NOR-Chr4 (NR4) splenic B cells. Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) in humans and the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model results from autoreactive T cell destruction of pancreatic beta cells.     A pathogenic role for B lymphocytes (B cells) in T1D first became evident when NOD mice made deficient in this population through introduction of an inactivated Igµ heavy chain gene (NOD.Igµnull) or chronic treatment with anti-IgM antibodies were strongly protected from disease.     We produced an NOD background strain developing a greatly decreased T1D incidence due to a NOR-derived 44.31Mb congenic region from rs3674285 to D4Mit127 on distal Chr. 4 (termed NOD.NOR-Chr4 (NR4)) containing disease resistance alleles decreasing the pathogenic activity of autoreactive B cells.     Microarrays were conducted on B cells purified from spleens of NOD and NR4 mice to highlight differentially expressed genes within the distal Chr. 4 locus.     B cells were either cultured in media alone (unstimulated) or with BCR cross-linking anti-IgM-F(ab’)2 fragments (stimulated) for 2h before RNA was extracted for transcript analysis.     B cells from three independent lots of pooled spleens (n=7-8) from NOD or NR4 female mice, respectively, were purified using a magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) negative depletion strategy.     Purified B cells from each lot were resuspended at 1x10 7  cells/ml for 2h in complete RPMI media alone or with 10µg/ml AffiniPure goat anti-mouse IgM F(ab’)2 fragments.     RNA was then purified from B cells and subjected to one-cycle linear amplification and biotin labeling.     Two BCR-stimulated and three unstimulated NOD B cell samples plus three BCR-stimulated and three unstimulated NR4 B cell samples were hybridized to Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays.
 E-GEOD-21710 - Insulin receptor signaling in osteoblasts regulates postnatal bone acquisition and body composition Global energy balance in mammals is controlled by the actions of circulating hormones that coordinate fuel production and utilization in metabolically active tissues.      Bone-derived osteocalcin, in its undercarboxylated, hormonal form, regulates fat deposition and is a potent insulin secretagogue.      Here, we show that insulin receptor (IR) signaling in osteoblasts controls osteoblast development and osteocalcin expression by suppressing the Runx2 inhibitor Twist-2.  Mice lacking IR in osteoblasts have low circulating undercarboxylated osteocalcin and reduced bone acquisition due to decreased bone formation and deficient numbers of osteoblasts.      With age, these mice develop marked peripheral adiposity and hyperglycemia accompanied by severe glucose intolerance and insulin resistance.      The metabolic abnormalities in these mice are improved by infusion of exogenous under-carboxylated osteocalcin.      These results indicate the existence of a bone-pancreas endocrine loop through which insulin signaling in the osteoblast ensures osteoblast differentiation and stimulates osteocalcin production, which in turn regulates insulin sensitivity and pancreatic insulin secretion to control glucose homeostasis.     We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression changes in response to insulin acting through insulin receptor in osteoblasts and identified distinct genes specifically involved in bone remodeling process.     4 groups and 3 time points (0h as a control, 6h, 12h, and 24h)
 E-GEOD-48381 - ChIp-Chip using RNAP II, CREB C/EBPb and cJun antibody in undifferentiated or differentiated keratinocytes (ChIP-Chip) Combinatorial recruitment of CREB, C/EBPb and Jun determines activation of promoters upon keratinocyte differentiation Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of RNAP II, CREB C/EBPb and cJun in undifferentiated or differentiated keratinocytes demonstrate recruitment of RNAP II to promoters bound by combination of specific transcription factors comparison of undifferentiated and differentated keratinocytes
 E-GEOD-13074 - Transcription profiling of mouse ark adapted and light damaged BALBc (albino) retinal pigmented epithelium Transcriptional profiles were compared between dark adapted and light damaged BALBc (albino) mouse RPE. Experiment Overall Design: BALBc mice were dark adapted for one week.     To produce light damage a subset of the mice were then exposed to 6,000 lux white fluorescent light for 1.5 hours.     RPEs were collected for RNA extraction 24 hours after light damage.
 E-GEOD-51080 - Expression data from exposure of BAT and WAT at 6 and 28 degrees C We run microarrays from three per group Sv129 female mice, ten weeks old, which were maintained at 28°C (warm conditions) or 6° C (cold stimulated) for ten days, while standard animal house temperature is 22 °C. After ten days, three types of tissue were collected: Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT), Mesenteric (visceral) White Adipose Tissue (MES) and Posterior Subcutaneous White Adipose Tissue (WAT) Different adipose tissue depots were taken for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.     We sought to determine the differences between white and brown adipose tissues at different temperatures

 E-GEOD-20621 - Transcription profiling by array of Mus musculus colonic mucosa after treatment with dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) for 2 or 7 days which induces experimental colitis BACKGROUND: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g (PPAR g) is a nuclear receptor whose activation has been shown to modulate macrophage and epithelial cell-mediated inflammation.      The objective of this study was to use a systems approach for investigating the mechanism by which the deletion of PPAR g in epithelial cells modulates the severity of dextran-sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, immune cell distribution and global gene expression.     RESULTS: The deficiency of PPAR g in epithelial cells does not significantly affect disease activity or body weight but worsens colon histopathlogy.     WT mice have greater CD4+IL10+ T cells and fewer MHC II+ macrophages in mesenteric lymph nodes.     Global gene expression analysis reveals greater changes after 7 days of DSS challenge (compared to 2 days). Colonic mucosa from VC- (WT) and VC+ (PPARg knock-out in epithelial cells) mice were sampled at 0 (no DSS), 2, and 7 days of DSS-induced experimental colitis
 E-GEOD-6858 - Transcription profiling by array of lungs from mice mutant for RAG after challenge with ovalbumin Experimental asthma was induced in BALB/c mice by sensitization and challenge with the allergen ovalbumin.     Control groups received PBS. To investigate the innate immune component of experimental asthma, we also analyzed recombinase activating gene (RAG) deficient mice following exposure to ovalbumin and control PBS Experiment Overall Design: Each experimental group was exposed to ovalbumin or control PBS. At day 22, 1 day after completion of the allergen exposure, whole lungs were harvested, total mRNA prepared, and gene expression determined by hybridization to Affymetrix microarrays.
 E-GEOD-7694 - Transcription profiling of mouse Cannabinoid receptor double knockouts (Cnr1 -/- /Cnr2 -/-) in CHS model to investigate cutaneous contact hypersensitivity We evaluated cutaneous contact hypersensitivity (CHS) in Cnr1-/-/Cnr2-/- animals using the obligate contact allergen 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB), which generates a specific cutaneous T-cell mediated allergic response upon repeated allergen contact.     Allergic contact dermatitis affects about 5% of men and 11% of women in industrialized countries and is one of the leading causes for occupational diseases.     In an animal model for cutaneous contact hypersensitivity we show that mice lacking both known cannabinoid receptors display exacerbated allergic inflammation.     In contrast, fatty acid amide hydrolase deficient mice, which have increased levels of the endocannabinoid anandamide, displayed reduced allergic responses in the skin.     Cannabinoid receptor antagonists exacerbated whereas receptor agonists attenuated allergic inflammation.     These results demonstrate a protective role of the endocannabinoid system in contact allergy in the skin, and suggest a novel target for therapeutic intervention.     Experiment Overall Design: Three wildtype mice (Wt) and three Cnr1-/-/Cnr2-/- (Ko) mice were used.     Contact hypersensitivity was determined always at the right ears, which therefore were treated with DNFB (Tr). Left ears of mice were kept untreated and served as control ears (C). A total of 12 hybridizations were performed (2 strains x 2 treatments X 3 biological replicates) in this experiment.
 E-GEOD-46871 - Hippocampal gene expression profiling of a model of Alzheimer`s Disease upon treatment with the ACE inhibitor captopril Extracellular senile plaques of amyloid beta (Abeta) are a pathological hallmark in brain of patients with Alzheimer`s Disease (AD). Abeta is generated by the amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Concomitant to Abeta load, AD brain is characterized by an increase in protein level and activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE inhibitors are a widely used class of drugs with established benefits for patients with cardiovascular disease.     However, the role of ACE and ACE inhibition in the development of Abeta plaques and the process of AD-related neurodegeneration is not clear since ACE was reported to degrade Abeta.     To investigate the effect of ACE inhibition on AD-related pathomechanisms, we used Tg2576 mice with neuron-specific expression of APPSwe as AD model.     From 12 months of age, substantial Abeta plaque load accumulates in the hippocampus of Tg2576 mice as a brain region, which is highly vulnerable to AD-related neurodegeneration.     The effect of central ACE inhibition was studied by treatment of 12 month-old Tg2576 mice for six months with the brain penetrating ACE inhibitor captopril.     At an age of 18 months, hippocampal gene expression profiling was performed of captopril-treated Tg2576 mice relative to untreated 18 month-old Tg2576 controls with high Abeta plaque load.     As an additional control, we used 12 month-old Tg2576 mice with low Abeta plaque load.     Whole genome microarray gene expression profiling revealed gene expression changes induced by the brain-penetrating ACE inhibitor captopril, which could reflect the neuro-regenerative potential of central ACE inhibition.     Microarray gene expression profiling was performed of hippocampi isolated from aged, 18 month-old Tg2576 (APPSwe-transgenic) AD mice with high Abeta plaque load relative to age-matched Tg2576 mice, which were treated for 6 months with the centrally active ACE inhibitor captopril.     Another study group consisted of 12 month-old Tg2576 mice with low Abeta plaque load.     In total, three study groups were analyzed, i.e. (i) 18 month-old untreated Tg2576 mice with high Abeta plaque load, (ii) age-matched Tg2576 mice treated for 6 months with the brain-penetrating ACE inhibitor captopril (20 mg/kg body weight/day in drinking water), and (iii) untreated 12 month-old Tg2576 mice with low Abeta plaque load reflecting the time point when captopril treatment was initiated.     Two biological replicates were made of each group, and total hippocampal RNA of four mice was pooled for one gene chip.
 E-GEOD-19684 - Transcription profiling by array of mouse granule neuron progenitors overexpressing Gli1, Atoh1, or Math-ER, treated or untreated with tamoxifen The morphogen and mitogen, Sonic Hedgehog, activates a Gli1-dependent transcription program that drives proliferation of granule neuron progenitors (GNPs) within the external germinal layer of the postnatally developing cerebellum.      Medulloblastomas with mutations activating the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway preferentially arise within the external germinal layer, and the tumor cells closely resemble GNPs.  Atoh1/Math1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor essential for GNP histogenesis, does not induce medulloblastomas when expressed in primary mouse GNPs that are explanted from the early postnatal cerebellum and transplanted back into the brains of naïve mice.      However, enforced expression of Atoh1 in primary GNPs enhances the oncogenicity of cells overexpressing Gli1 by almost three orders of magnitude.      Unlike Gli1, Atoh1 cannot support GNP proliferation in the absence of Sonic Hedgehog signaling and does not govern expression of canonical cell cycle genes.      Instead, Atoh1 maintains GNPs in a Sonic Hedgehog-responsive state by regulating genes that trigger neuronal differentiation, including many expressed in response to bone morphogenic protein-4.  Therefore, by targeting multiple genes regulating the differentiation state of GNPs, Atoh1 collaborates with the pro-proliferative Gli1-dependent transcriptional program to influence medulloblastoma development.      Keywords: disease state analysis 14 samples, 1 time series, 2 engineered Medulloblastoma tumors
 E-GEOD-66791 - TMEM203 is a Novel Regulator of Intracellular Calcium Homeostasis and is required for Spermatogenesis Intracellular calcium signaling is critical for initiating and sustaining diverse cellular functions including transcription, synaptic signaling, muscle contraction, apoptosis and fertilization.        Trans-membrane 203 (TMEM203) was identified here in cDNA overexpression screens for proteins capable of modulating intracellular calcium levels using activation of  a calcium/calcineurin regulated transcription factor as an indicator.     Overexpression of TMEM203 resulted in a reduction of Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) calcium stores and elevation in basal cytoplasmic calcium levels.     TMEM203 protein was localized to the ER and found associated with a number of ER proteins which regulate ER calcium entry and efflux.     Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from Tmem203 deficient mice had reduced ER calcium stores and altered calcium homeostasis.      Tmem203 deficient mice were viable though male knockout mice were infertile and exhibited a severe block in spermiogenesis and spermiation.      Expression profiling studies showed significant alternations in expression of calcium channels and pumps in testes and concurrently Tmem203 deficient spermatocytes demonstrated significantly altered calcium handling.     Thus Tmem203 is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of cellular calcium homeostasis, is required for spermatogenesis and provides a causal link between intracellular calcium regulation and spermiogenesis.     Testes were  harvested from control and Tmem203 null mice at 24 weeks of age.      4 wild type testes and 5 null mice testes were probed  using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 platform.
 E-GEOD-39770 - Expression data from embryonic stem cells following siRNA transfection of UPS members [Differentiation ES] While transcriptional regulation of stem cell self-renewal and differentiation has been extensively studied, only a small number of studies have addressed the roles for post-translational modifications in these processes.      A key mechanism of post-translational modification is ubiquitination by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Using UPS-targeted RNAi screens, we identify novel regulators of pluripotency and differentiation.     We focus on two of these proteins, the deubiquitinating enzyme, Psmd14, and the E3 ligase, Fbxw7, and characterize their importance in ES cell pluripotency and cellular reprogramming.     Embryonic stem cells were reverse transfected with siRNA, and differentiated for 48hrs in conditions with retinoic acid, 48 hrs post transfection cells were isloated for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays
 E-GEOD-38053 - Host Response Signature to Staphylococcus aureus alpha-Hemolysin Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia causes significant morbidity and mortality.     Alpha-hemolysin (Hla), a pore-forming cytotoxin of S. aureus, has been identified through animal models of pneumonia as a critical virulence factor that induces lung injury.     In spite of considerable molecular knowledge of how this cytotoxin injures the host, the precise host response to Hla in the context of infection remains poorly understood.     We employed whole-genome expression profiling of infected lung to define the host response to wild-type S. aureus compared with an Hla-deficient isogenic mutant in experimental pneumonia.     These data provide a complete expression profile at four and at twenty-four hours post-infection, revealing a unique response to the toxin-expressing strain.     Gene ontogeny analysis revealed significant differences in the extracellular matrix and cardiomyopathy pathways, both of which govern cellular interactions in the tissue microenvironment.     Evaluation of individual transcript responses to Hla-secreting bacteria was notable for upregulation of host cytokine and chemokine genes, including the p19 subunit of interleukin-23. Consistent with this observation, the cellular immune response to infection was characterized by a prominent TH17 response to wild-type staphylococci.     These findings define specific host mRNA responses to Hla-producing S. aureus, coupling the pulmonary TH17 response to the presence of this cytotoxin.     Expression profiling to define the host response to a single virulence factor proved to be a valuable tool in identifying pathways for further investigation in S. aureus pneumonia.     This approach may be broadly applicable to the study of bacterial toxins, defining host pathways that can be targeted to mitigate toxin-induced disease.     Animals were treated with PBS, S. aureus wild-type, or S. aureus Hla-deficient isogenic mutant.
 E-GEOD-38067 - Hepatic gene expression in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice fed a quercetin diet Quercetin is a food component that may ameliorate the diabetic symptoms.      We examined hepatic gene expression of BALB/c mice with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes to elucidate the mechanism of the protective effect of dietary quercetin on diabetes-associated liver injury.     We fed STZ-induced diabetic mice with diets containing 0.1% or 0.5% quercetin for 2 weeks and compared the patterns of hepatic gene expression in these groups of mice using a DNA microarray.     Diets containing 0.1% or 0.5% quercetin lowered the STZ-induced increase in blood glucose levels and improved plasma insulin levels.     A cluster analysis of the hepatic gene expressions showed that 0.5% quercetin diet suppressed STZ-induced alteration of gene expression.      Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the quercetin diets had their greatest suppressive effect on the STZ-induced elevation of expression of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21(WAF1/Cip1) (Cdkn1a). Six-week-old male mice were divided into 4 groups of 6 mice each, housed in groups of 3 per cage.     After 1 week mice were intraperitoneally injected with STZ.  Mice (n=6) in the untreated control group did not receive any treatment.     After 1 week, 18 mice showing non-fasting blood glucose levels of 230-400 mg/dL were divided into 3 groups: one group was fed with AIN93G only (control group), the others with an AIN93G diet containing 0.1% or 0.5% quercetin (Funakoshi, Tokyo, Japan) for 2 weeks.
 E-GEOD-45577 - Profiling of glycerol- and CTX-induced models of muscle regeneration in mice Utilizing glycerol and cardiotoxin (CTX) injections in the tibialis anterior muscles of M. musculus provides models of skeletal muscle damages followed by skeletal muscle regeneration.     In particular, glycerol-induced muscle regeneration is known to be associated with ectopic adipogenesis.     We characterized genome-wide expression profiles of tibialis anterior muscles from wild-type mice injured by either glycerol or CTX injection.     Our goal was to detect gene expression changes during the time course of glycerol-induced and CTX-induced muscle regeneration models, that can lead to ectopic adipocyte accumulation.     Tibialis anterior muscle of 12 week old wildtype C57BL/6J male mice injected i.m with either glycerol or CTX were collected 3, 7, 14 or 21 days after injection.     6 biological replicates were used for each time points.     Please note that a few replicate samples did not pass QC test, thus, were removed from the submission.     Unchallenged tibialis anterior muscles from a group of 5 wildtype C57BL/6J mice were also as a control.     Total RNA was extracted, QCed and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays.
 E-GEOD-10467 - Transcription profiling of a mouse  macrophage cell line TO investigating genes regulated BY mir-155 Mammalian microRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as key regulators of the development and function of the immune system.     Here, we report a strong but transient induction of miR-155 in mouse bone marrow after injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) correlated with granulocyte/monocyte (GM) expansion.     Demonstrating the sufficiency of miR-155 to drive GM expansion, enforced expression in mouse bone marrow cells caused GM proliferation in a manner reminiscent of LPS treatment.     However, the mir-155-induced GM populations displayed pathological features characteristic of myeloid neoplasia.     Extending possible relevance to human disease, miR-155 was overexpressed in the bone marrow of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Furthermore, miR-155 repressed a subset of genes implicated in hematopoietic development and disease.     These data implicate miR-155 as a contributor to physiological GM expansion during inflammation and to certain pathological features associated with AML, emphasizing the importance of proper miR-155 regulation in developing myeloid cells during times of inflammatory stress.     Experiment Overall Design: Construct stable RAW264.7 mouse macrophage cell lines expressing mir-155 or empty vector.     RNA is extracted and global gene expression analysis performed to identify mir-155 regulated mRNAs.
 E-GEOD-29647 - Expression data from 9 and 13 weeks old TIFIAD1Cre mice We have investigated the p53-dependent stress response in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that degenerate in Huntington’s disease.     To induce p53 signaling cascade, we have genetically inactivated by the Cre/loxP system the essential RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription factor TIF-IA, leading to stabilization of p53 and induction of p53-dependent apoptosis.     In the present study, we selectively ablated the TIF-IA gene in MSNs by crossing TIF-IAflox/flox mice, homozygous for the floxed TIF-IA allele with transgenic mice expressing the Cre recombinase under the control of the D1 dopamine receptor (D1R) promoter.     To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying survival and death we profiled global gene expression in 9 and 13 week old control and TIF-IAD1RCre mutant mice (3 mice/each timepoint For each of the four conditions, five GeneChips were used each )
 E-GEOD-13693 - Transcription profiling of normal mouse myeloid cell populations Normal myeloid lineage cell populations (C57BL/6 mice, aged 4-10 weeks, male or female) with three distinct immunophenotypes were prospectively isolated and characterized.     In preparation for FACS sorting, bone marrow cells were separated into c-kit+ and c-kit- fractions using an AutoMACS device.     C-kit+ cells were further fractionated based on Gr1 and Mac1 expression, and absence of lineage antigen expression (B220, TER119, CD3, CD4, CD8 and IL7Rα), by cell sorting.     C-kit+ Gr1+ Mac1lo/- and c-kit+ Gr1+ Mac1+ displayed cytologic features of undifferentiated hematopoietic cells or myeloblasts, whereas c-kit- Gr1+ Mac1+ cells were mature neutrophils.     Experiment Overall Design: See summary.
 E-GEOD-11333 - Chromatin immunopreciptation of mouse overexpressing ELAV-like protein HuD Post-transcriptional mechanisms play an important role in the control of gene expression.     RNA-binding proteins are key players in the post-transcriptional control of many neural genes and they participate in multiple processes, from RNA splicing and mRNA transport to mRNA stability and translation.     Our laboratory has developed the first mouse model overexpressing a RNA-binding protein, the ELAV-like protein HuD, in the CNS under the control of the CaMKinII alpha promoter.     Initial behavioral characterization of the mice revealed that they had significant learning deficits together with abnormalities in prepulse inhibition (PPI). At the molecular level, we found that the expression of the growth-associated protein GAP-43, one of the targets of HuD, was increased in the hippocampus of HuD transgenic mice.     Besides binding and stabilizing the GAP-43 mRNA, HuD was shown to bind in vitro or in vivo the mRNAs of acetylcholinesterase, tau, p21, neuroserpin, and MARCKS among others.      To identify additional targets of HuD, we propose to pull down the RNAs bound to myc-tagged HuD in vivo in the brains of HuD transgenic mice, to isolate these bound RNAs and use these to probe DNA microarrays.     We will use pull downs using non-immune IgGs as controls.     To test our hypothesis we propose 2 specific aims:; 1) To identify the targets of HuD in HuD overexpressor mice and; 2) To compare these target mRNAs to those we identified  previously  as having increased levels of expression in the hippocampus of HuD transgenic mice (see protocol # Perrone-Bizzozero-5R01NS030255-12) and/or those that show increased expression in dentate granule cells of HuD transgenic mice ( protocol # perro-affy-mouse-309741); Based upon the role of the RNA-binding HuD in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity, we expect that HuD targets will include mRNAs for proteins involved in these processes.     All mice are in C57BL/6 background and are male approximately 60 days old.     To identify target of HuD in our transgenic mice, we will homogenize the homogenize the hippocampi  (2 per animal) of 3 transgenic mice and use these protein extracts for immunoprecipitation assays.     Briefly, transgenic myc-tagged HuD protein will be immunoprecipitated using myc-tag antibodies and protein-G agarose beads and samples will be sent to T-Gen for RNA isolation, single round amplification and probing of DNA microarrays.     We will use non-immune IgG as a negative control.     Conditions:; Pooled Extracts from 3 transgenic mice IP with myc-tag antibodies: Triplicates; Pooled extract from 3 transgenic mice IP with non-immune IgGs (negative control): duplicates
 E-GEOD-44339 - Identification of Ccr4-Not complex as a regulator of transition from partial to genuine iPS cells Partial induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs) are cell lines strayed from normal route from somatic cells to iPSCs and are immortalized.     Mouse partial iPSCs are able to convert to real iPSCs by the exposure to 2i condition using MAPK and GSK3? inhibitors.     However, the molecular mechanisms of this conversion are totally not known.     Our piggyback vector mediated genome-wide screen revealed that Cnot2, one of core components of Ccr4-Not complex participates in this conversion.     Subsequent analyses revealed other core components, i.e., Cnot1 and Cnot3 and Trim28 which is known to extensively share genomic binding sites with Cnot3 contribute to this conversion as well.     Our bioinformatics analyses indicate that the major role of these factors in the conversion is the down-regulation of developmental genes in partial iPSCs. Two partial iPSC clones (2B1 and 5C5) cultured under conventional culture condition with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and serum and those converted to iPSCs by the exposure to 2i condition were used for RNA source.     Partial iPSCs (2B1) cultured under conventional condition in which either one of Cnot1, Cnot2, Cnot3 and Trim28 cDNA or these factors were combinatorially incorporated after retrovirus infection and those in which empty vector or Nanog were stably integrated were also used for RNA source.     In addition, embryonic fibroblasts and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from 13.5 dpc embryos and blastocysts, respectively, from Nanog-GFP transgenic mice and wild-type ESC line (EBRTcH3) were used for RNA source.
 E-GEOD-58032 - Association of prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia patients with leukemia stem cell gene signature based on nucleostemin promoter activity Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous neoplastic disorder, in which only a subset of cells have function as leukemia-initiating cells (LICs). In this study, we prospectively evaluated leukemia-initiating capacity of fractionated subpopulations of AML cells depending on expression of a nucleolar GTP binding protein, Nucleostemin (NS). To monitor NS expression in living AML cells, we generated a mouse AML model using a transgenic mouse, in which green florescence protein (GFP) is expressed under the control of particular region of NS promoter (NS-GFP). In AML cells, NS-GFP levels were correlated with endogenous NS mRNA. AML cells with the highest expression of NS-GFP were very immature blast-like cells, efficiently formed leukemia colonies in vitro, and exhibited high leukemia-initiating capacity in vivo.     Gene expression profiling analysis revealed that cell cycle regulators and nucleotide metabolism-related genes were highly enriched in a gene set associated with leukemia-initiating capacity, i.e., leukemia stem cell gene signature.     Furthermore, we found that the leukemia stem cell gene signature stratified human AML patients into two distinct clusters, reflecting prognosis.     These data demonstrate that the mouse leukemia stem cell gene signature is significantly associated with malignant properties of human AML patients.     Further analyses of gene regulation related with leukemia stem cells would provide novel insights for the progress in diagnostic and therapeutic approach of AML patients.     A mouse acute myeloid leukemia model was generated by introduction of HoxA9/Meis1 to bone marrow cells from a transgenic mouse, in which green florescence protein (GFP) is expressed under the control of particular region of NS promoter (NS-GFP).The leukemia cells were fractionated into 4 subpopulations based on NS-GFP level and c-Kit expression,  (a) c-Kit-NS-GFPlow, (b) c-Kit-NS-GFPmiddle, (c) c-Kit+NS-GFPmiddle and (d) c-Kit+NS-GFPhigh cells.
 E-GEOD-6735 - Gene expression changes in aortas of mice on high fat versus regular chow diet. To determine effects of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance on arterial wall biology, gene expression profiles were generated using aortas from mice on high fat (35% fat) diet and their respective non diabetic regular chow fed controls.     Keywords: Chip Experiment was done in triplicate with three independent pools from test mice on high fat diet and control mice on regular chow diet.     For RNA isolation aortas were striped of adventitia and periaortic fat.     RNA from three aortas was pooled for the synthesis of probe for affymetrix array analysis.
 E-GEOD-30473 - Myc and Miz-1 control melanocyte senescence by regulating intracellular cystathionase levels The development of malignant melanoma is a highly complex process which is still poorly understood despite extensive research.     A majority of human melanomas are found to express a handful of oncogenic proteins, such as mutant RAS and BRAF. However, these oncogenes are also found in nevi, and it is now a well-accepted fact that their expression alone leads to senescence.     This renders the understanding of senescence escape mechanisms an important criterion to understand tumor development.       Here, we describe the ability of the transcription factor MYC to drive the evasion of reactive oxygen stress-induced melanocyte senescence, caused by activated receptor tyrosine kinase signaling.     Conversely, MIZ1, the growth suppressing interaction partner of MYC, is involved in mediating melanocyte senescence.     Both, MYC overexpression and Miz1 knockdown led to a strong reduction of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage and senescence.     We identified the cystathionase (CTH) gene product as mediator of the ROS-related MYC and MIZ1 effects.     Blocking CTH enzymatic activity in MYC-overexpressing and Miz1 knockdown cells increased intracellular stress and senescence.     Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of cystathionase in human melanoma cells also reconstituted senescence in many cell lines, and CTH knockdown reduced tumorigenic effects such as proliferation, H2O2 resistance and soft agar growth.     Thus, we identified cystathionase as new MYC target gene with an important function in MYC-mediated senescence evasion.     total samples analysed are 4
 E-GEOD-16682 - Murine M7 leukemia derived from retroviral insertional mutagenesis of Gata1s fetal progenitors The goal of this study is to derive a mouse model of human Down Syndrome (DS) megakaryocytic leukemia involving mutations in the hematopoietic transcription factor, GATA1 (called GATA1s mutation). We achieved this through transduction of Gata1s mutant fetal progenitors by MSCV-based retrovirus expressing a GFP marker, followed by in vitro selection (for immortalized cell lines), and then in vivo selection (for transformed cell lines) through transplantation.     Here we report one such cell line [T6(6)] that gives rise to megakaryocytic leukemia (M7 leukemia) upon transplantation.     Since the leukemic cells were retrovirally tagged with a GFP reporter, we sorted GFP+ leukemic blasts and generated their expression profiles by microarray.
 E-GEOD-9400 - Transcription profiling of mouse quadriceps muscle after exposure to chronic, normobaric and hypobaric hypoxic environments for 2 weeks To address whether hypoxia contributes to muscle patho-physiology, normal, adult C57 mice were exposed to chronic, normobaric and hypobaric hypoxic environments for 2 weeks in order to simulate levels of hypoxaemia reported in DMD patients with advanced respiratory insufficiency.     Control mice were maintained under normoxic conditions.     Control and experimental mice were studied.     Experiment Overall Design: Adult male C57Bl/10 mice were used in experiments.     At the beginning of the experiment mice were divided into two groups, control (room condition) and hypoxic (hypoxic condition), over a period of 2 weeks.     The hypoxic group was gradually exposed to lower levels of hypoxia in an especially designed and hermetically closed hypoxic chamber.     A Pegas 4000 MF(Columbus Instruments) gas blending system was used.     The oxygen level was gradually decreased from 21% to 8% over one week and animals were kept at 8% oxygen for another 7 days.     Animal’s weights were monitored daily.     Food and water were changed daily for the time of the experiment.     After two weeks animals were euthanized using CO2, Extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and Soleus muscles were dissected for physiological studies.     Prior to physiological analysis each group was divided into two smaller groups (subgroups). In the first subgroup the primary focus on physiological muscle analysis was on (EDL) while in the other subgroup it was on Soleus.     This division allowed us that both muscles, EDL and Soleus were analyzed at the same time after euthanization.     Experiment Overall Design: RNA isolation  Experiment Overall Design: Total RNA was isolated from each QF muscle by Tri-Reagent (Ambion, Austin, TX) as described by manufacturer.     Isolated total RNA were cleaned up by RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as described by manufacturer.     The purity and concentration of total RNA were determined by measurement of absorbance at 260 and 280nm using a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). To satisfy our purity criteria, we discarded all RNA samples that did not have a 260/280 ratio between 1.8 and 2.1. To satisfy our criteria for integrity, we required that all RNA used in our experiments have single peaks for the 18S and 28S bands as determined by the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies Inc., Palo Alto, CA).  Experiment Overall Design: Linear amplification and cRNA labeling Experiment Overall Design: Three microliter total RNA was used for each sample to obtain linearly amplified labeled cRNA by using GeneChip® One-Cycle Target Labeling kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) as manufacturer described.     Briefly; total RNA was used to generate double-stranded cDNA with the T7-oligo (dT) primer.     This double-stranded cDNA was used in vitro transcription and biotin labeling steps.     Labeled cRNA yield and purity were determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 and 280nm. All the cRNA 260/280 ratios were between 1.9 and 2.1. Quality control (QC) of the labeled cRNA products was assessed by performing 1µg labeled cRNA on 2% agarose gel to see similar RNA smear type.     Experiment Overall Design: Fragmentation and microarray hybridization Experiment Overall Design: Fifteen micrograms labeled cRNA of hypoxic or normoxic QF muscle was fragmented, and 10μg was hybridized to Affymetrix® Mouse 430 ver 2.0 GeneChip arrays for 18–24h (Affymetrix Inc.). Each microarray was washed and stained with streptavidin–phycoerythrin and scanned at a 6-μm resolution with Agilent model G2500A GeneArray scanner A visual quality control measurement was performed to ensure proper hybridization after each chip was scanned.
 E-GEOD-10192 - PPAR Controls Gene Expression in MSC Cells Rosiglitazone (Rosi), a member of the thiazolidinedione class of drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes, activates the adipocyte-specific transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg). This activation causes bone loss in animals and humans, at least in part due to suppression of osteoblast differentiation from marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). In order to identify mechanisms by which PPARg2 suppresses osteoblastogenesis and promotes adipogenesis in MSC, we have analyzed the PPARg2 transcriptome in response to Rosi.     A total of 4,252 transcriptional changes resulted when Rosi (1 uM) was applied to the U-33 marrow stromal cell line, stably transfected with PPARg2 (U-33/g2), as compared to non-induced U-33/g2 cells.     Differences between U-33/g2 and U-33 cells stably transfected with empty vector (U-33/c) comprised 7,928 transcriptional changes, independent of Rosi.     Cell type-, time- and treatment-specific gene clustering uncovered distinct patterns of PPARg2 transcriptional control of MSC lineage commitment.     The earliest changes accompanying Rosi activation of PPARg2 included adjustments in morphogenesis, Wnt signaling, and immune responses, as well as sustained induction of lipid metabolism.     Expression signatures influenced by longer exposure to Rosi provided evidence for distinct mechanisms governing the repression of osteogenesis and stimulation of adipogenesis.     Our results suggest interactions that could lead to the identification of a “master” regulatory scheme controlling osteoblast differentiation.      Keywords: rosiglitazone, PPARgamma, microarray, time course, gene expression, stem cells U-33/g2 and U-33/c cells were cultured in the presence or absence of Rosi and gene expression was monitored at three different time points (2, 24, 72h) after exposure to the agonist.     Each time point corresponds to a separate stage of Rosi-treated U-33/g2 cell conversion from the osteoblast-like phenotype to the adipocyte-like phenotype and includes induction (2h), intermediate alterations in phenotype progression (24h), and a terminally differentiated adipocytic with completely suppressed osteoblastic phenotype (72h). The experiment is a full factorial design performed in replicate.
 E-GEOD-26299 - Gene expression profiling in DBA/2J glaucoma In this study that was specifically designed to identify early stages of glaucoma in DBA/2J mice, we used genome-wide expression profiling and a series of computational methods.     Our methods successfully subdivided eyes with no detectable glaucoma by conventional assays into molecularly defined stages of disease.     These stages represent a temporally ordered sequence of glaucoma states.     Using an array of tools, we then determined networks and biological processes that are altered at these early stages.     Our strategy proved very sensitive, suggesting that similar approaches will be valuable for uncovering early processes in other complex, later-onset diseases.     Early changes included upregulation of both the complement cascade and endothelin system, and so we tested the therapeutic value of separately inhibiting them.     Mice with a mutation in the complement component 1a gene (C1qa) were robustly protected from glaucoma with the protection being among the greatest reported.     Similarly, inhibition of the endothelin system was strongly protective.     Since EDN2 is potently vasoconstrictive and was produced by microglial/macrophages, our data provide a novel link between these cell types and vascular dysfunction in glaucoma.     Targeting early events such as the upregulation of the complement and endothelin pathways may provide effective new treatments for human glaucoma.     Genome-wide assessment of gene expression changes was performed in DBA/2J mice.     The optic nerve head and retina from 40 DBA/2J eyes at 10.5 months of age were separately profiled.     These eyes were selected as they encompassed a range of glaucoma severity.     Two control groups were also included; 10 eyes from 10.5 months old D2-Gpnmb+ mice (age and strain matched, no glaucoma control) and 10 eyes from 4.5 months old DBA/2J mice (young, pre-glaucoma).
 E-GEOD-11291 - Transcription profiling of mouse heart, brain, and skeletal muscle to determine the rffect of age, calorie restriction and resveratrol on gene expression Resveratrol in high doses has been shown to extend lifespan in some studies in invertebrates and to prevent early mortality in mice fed a high-fat diet.     We fed mice from middle age (14-months) to old age (30-months) either a control diet, a low dose of resveratrol (4.9 mg kg-1 day-1), or a calorie restricted (CR) diet and examined genome-wide transcriptional profiles.     We report a striking transcriptional overlap of CR and resveratrol in heart, skeletal muscle and brain.     Both dietary interventions inhibit gene expression profiles associated with cardiac and skeletal muscle aging.     Gene expression profiling suggests that both CR and resveratrol may retard some aspects of aging through alterations in chromatin structure and transcription.     Resveratrol, at doses that can be readily achieved in humans, fulfills the definition of a dietary compound that mimics some aspects of CR. Experiment Overall Design: Heart, neocortex tissue, and gastrocnemius muscle was collected from young and old mice at 5 and 30 months of age, respectively; mice were subjected to either a calorie restricted diet or a control diet supplemented with resveratrol

 E-GEOD-1082 - Eye development in mouse and rat In this series the ocular primordium was microdissected from normal CD-1 (outbred) mouse embryos harvested days 8-10 post-coitus, corresponding to human development during the 3rd-4th weeks post-fertilization.     The precise embryological age was ascertained by counting somite pairs to an accuracy of +/- 2 pairs per litter.     Samples were pooled as follows: optic pit pooled from 48-50 embryos (6 litters) on 8 d.p.c. (4-8 somite pairs), optic vesicle pooled from 36-40 embryos (5 litters) on 9 d.p.c. (16-20 somite pairs), and optic cip pooled from 27-30 embryos (3 litters) on 10 d.p.c. (28-32 somite pairs). The common reference for this series was RNA collected from embryonic headfold microdissected on 8 d.p.c. RNA samples were collected from CD-1 rat embryos at equivalent somite stages for the headfold, optic vesicle, and opic cup.      Keywords = embryo Keywords = eye development Keywords = mouse Keywords = rat
 E-GEOD-39897 - Expression data for mouse embryogenesis from oocyte to newborn Studies in mouse have led to enormous progress in our understanding of early human development.     The identification of genes and the signaling pathways involved in mouse embryogenesis have helped us to better understand fertilization, morulation, gastrulation, organogenesis and embryonic development in mammals.     We report a detailed analysis of the global gene expression profiles from oocyte to the end of organogenesis in mouse.     Our studies revealed distinct temporal regulation patterns for genes belonging to different functional categories, supporting their roles during organogenesis.     Mouse embryos were selected at successive stage for for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.     We sought to obtain homogeneous populations of embryos at each developmental stage in order to increase the temporal resolution of expression profiles.     To that end, we hand-selected embryos according to morphological criteria at 12 time-points from embryos to newborn
 E-GEOD-30684 - Stem Cell Antigen-1 (Sca-1) Regulates Mammary Tumor Development and Cell Migration Stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1 or Ly6A) is a member of the Ly6 family of glycosyl phostidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface proteins.     To determine the potential mechanisms by which Sca-1 regulates cell migration, adhesion, and tumor development; we performed an Affymetrix mouse genome 430A 2.0 array on cDNA comparing shLuc and shSca-1 from cells grown in vitro.     We performed an Affymetrix mouse genome 430A 2.0 array on cDNA comparing shLuc and shSca-1 from cells grown in vitro.      Experimental groups were profiled in biological triplicate.
 E-GEOD-14221 - TgFVB vs FVB 6 and 8 week kidneys Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is characterized clinically by both nephrosis and by rapidly progressive kidney dysfunction.     HIVAN is characterized histologically by both collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and prominent tubular damage.     Neutrophil Gelatinase Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) is known to be rapidly expressed in distal segments of the nephron at the onset of different types of acute kidney injury, but few studies have examined NGAL in chronic kidney disease models.     We found that urinary NGAL (uNGAL) was highly expressed by patients with biopsy proven HIVAN, whereas HIV+ patients without HIVAN demonstrated lower levels.     uNGAL was also highly expressed in the TgFVB mouse model of HIVAN, which demonstrated NGAL gene expression in dilated, microcystic segments of the nephron.     These data show that NGAL is markedly upregulated in the setting of HIVAN, and suggest that uNGAL levels may provide a non-invasive screening test to detect HIVAN related tubular disease.     Microarray data revealed that NGAL was one of the most highly upregulated gene the TgFVB mouse.
 E-GEOD-19668 - Genetic Determinants for Susceptibility to Staphylococcus aureus Infection in A/J and C57BL/6J Although it has recently been shown that A/J mice are highly susceptible to Staphylococcus aureus sepsis as compared to C57BL/6J, the specific genes responsible for this differential phenotype are unknown.     Using chromosome substitution strains (CSS), we found that factors on chromosomes (chr) 8, 11, and 18 are responsible for susceptibility to S. aureus sepsis in A/J mice.     F1 mice from C57BL/6J X CSS8 cross (C8A) and C57BL/6J X CSS18 (C18A) were also susceptible to S. aureus (median survival   48 h), whereas F1 mice from C57BL/6J X CSS11 cross (C11A) were resistant (median survival   120 h) to S. aureus.     Bacterial loads in the kidney were consistent with F1 median survivals, with higher bacterial counts in susceptible mice.     No sexlinked  associations with susceptibility were noted in F1 intercrosses.     Using whole genome transcription profiling, we identified a total of 192 genes on chromosomes 8, 11, and 18 which are differentially expressed between A/J and C57BL/6J in the setting of S. aureus infection.     Of these, 28 genes had Gene Ontology annotations indicating a potential immune response function.     These 28 genes are associated with susceptibility to S. aureus in A/J mice, and are potential determinants of susceptibility to S. aureus infection in humans.     To identify genes for which differential expression between A/J and C57BL/6J mice could contribute to host susceptibility to S. aureus infection, we compared the gene expression profiles between uninfected A/J and C57BL/6J mice and between infected A/J and C57BL/6J mice at 2, 4, 6, and 12 hours after infection.

 E-GEOD-10563 - Transcription profiling of mouse primary keratinocytes treated with Tamoxifen Genome-wide identification of bona fide targets of transcription factors in mammalian cells is still a challenge.     We present a novel integrated computational and experimental approach to identify direct targets of a transcription factor.     This consists in measuring time-course (dynamic) gene expression profiles upon perturbation of the transcription factor under study, and in applying a novel reverse-engineering” algorithm (TSNI) to rank genes according to their probability of being direct targets.     Using primary keratinocytes as a model system, we identified novel transcriptional target genes of Trp63, a crucial regulator of skin development.     TSNI-predicted Trp63 target genes were validated by Trp63 knockdown and by ChIP-chip to identify Trp63-bound regions in vivo.     Our study revealed that short sampling times, in the order of minutes, are needed to capture the dynamics of gene expression in mammalian cells.     We show that Trp63 transiently regulates a subset of its direct targets, thus highlighting the importance of considering temporal dynamics when identifying transcriptional targets.     Using this approach, we uncovered a previously unsuspected transient regulation of the AP-1 complex by Trp63, through direct regulation of a subset of AP-1 components.     The integrated experimental and computational approach described here is readily applicable to other transcription factors in mammalian systems and is complementary to genome-wide identification of transcription factor binding sites.     Experiment Overall Design: Primary keratinocytes were infected with an EMPTY retrovirus and treated with with Tamoxifen, cells were collected every 20 minutes up to 1 hours, and every hour up to 4 hours.
 E-GEOD-28447 - Expression data from transgenic mice overexpressing RXR-gamma in the skeletal muscle (RXR-gamma mice) Retinoid X receptor (RXR)-gamma is a nuclear receptor-type transcription factor expressed mostly in the skeletal muscle, and regulated by nutritional conditions.     Previously, we established transgenic mice overexpressing RXR-gamma in the skeletal muscle (RXR-gamma mice), which showed lower blood glucose than the control mice.     We used microarrays to investigate their glucose metabolism gene expression change.     RNA was isolated from the skeletal muscle of sex- and age-matched RXR-gamma mice and non-transgenic control mice (females at 4 months of age, five samples from each group were combined). Each of the combined samples of the two groups was hybridized to the Affymetrix MG430 microarray.
 E-GEOD-32288 - Gene expression profile in Yaf2 KD and/or RYBP KO ES cells. Gene expression change by Yaf2 KD in wild type or RYBP KO ES cells.     Total RNAs were extracted from the respective ES cells, and were subjected to microarray analysis using Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 arrays
 E-GEOD-62758 - Differential gene expression in spinal cords from WT mice during uninfected (baseline) conditions and after (2 days post) infection with Encephalomyocarditis Virus (EMCV) Previously, we reported that mice made transgenic for a picornaviral RdRP – the 3Dpol protein of Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) – suppress infection by diverse viral families.     How the picornaviral RdRP transgene exerted antiviral protection in vivo was not known.     To investigate the molecular mechanism, we determined gene expression profiles in spinal cords of WT and RdRP transgenic mice prior to (baseline) and after (2 days) infection with Encephalomyocarditis Virus (EMCV). Spinal cords from adult age-matched, sex-matched WT mice were harvested prior to (baseline) and after (2 days post) EMCV viral infection.     Total RNA was isolated (Qiagen RNeasy kit) and used as a template to synthesize biotinylated cRNA which was then hybridized to the HT Mouse Genome 430 2.0 GeneChip Array (Affymetrix).
 E-GEOD-4260 - Transcription profiling of cumulus cell oocyte complexes isolated at different time points of ovulation to identify differentially expressed genes. Cumulus-oocyte complexes were isolated at seperate time-points to generate temporal complexes.      Targets from two biological replicates at each time point (0h, 8h, 16h post-hCG treatment) were generated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays.      Comparisons between the sample groups allow the identification of genes with temporal expression patterns.     Experiment Overall Design: 2 eCG-primed (48h) pooled cumulus-oocyte complexes, 2 eCG-primed (48h) hCG-treated (8h) pooled cumulus-oocyte complexes, and 2 eCG-primed (48h) hCG-treated (16h) pooled cumulus-oocyte complexes replicates were analyzed
 E-GEOD-11679 - Transcription profiling of mouse Balb c/J offspring subjected to postnatal handling vs. controls Postnatal handling in rodents leads to decreased anxiety-like behavior in adulthood.      We used microarrays to look at gene expression differences in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in female mice subjected to postnatal handling compared to controls.     Experiment Overall Design: Balb c/J offspring were briefly separated from mothers for 15 minutes each morning on postnatal days 1-14 (handled group) or left undisturbed.      At 8 weeks of age mice were tested in the open-field and light-dark behavioral paradigms to verify a handling-induced behavioral phenotype.      2 weeks after behavioral testing, animals were sacrificed and the CA1 region was microdissected.      CA1 regions were stored at -20C in RNA later.      RNA was extracted from 8 samples (4 handled and 4 non-handled) using Trizol.      RNA was extracted from second group of animals (7 handled and 10 non-handled) using Qiagen RNA/DNA columns.      All total RNA samples were double round amplied and labeled using standard Affymetrix protocols and hybridized to Mouse 430 2.0 arrays in parallel.
 E-GEOD-14888 - Conjugated linoleic acid activates AMPK and reduces adiposity more effectively when used with metformin Trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (t10c12 CLA) causes dramatic reductions in white adipose tissue in mice but has had limited effectiveness in humans.      Determination of the signaling pathways involved may lead to better regulation of adiposity.     T10c12 CLA was found to activate AMP-activating protein kinase (AMPK), a central regulator of cell metabolism.      Compound C, a potent inhibitor of AMPK, prevents many of the typical responses to treatments with t10c12 CLA including the integrated stress response (ISR), the inflammatory response, the reduction in key lipogenic transcription factors, and delipidation.     Treatment of adipocytes or mice with t10c12 CLA in conjunction with AMPK activator metformin results in more delipidation than treatment with the individual chemicals.       Additionally, the combination showed a reduced inflammatory response relative to a t10c12 CLA treatment alone.     The combination of t10c12 CLA and metformin, widely used to treat insulin resistance and Type II diabetes, has potential as a treatment for reducing adiposity in humans.      Keywords: control/treatment Mouse 3T3-L1 RNA for was isolated from control linoleic acid (LA) and treatment (CLA, CLA+metformin, metformin) samples for analysis on microarrays with three biological reps.
 E-GEOD-61659 - Cross-species genomics identifies postanatal CPE as novel choroid plexus carcinoma oncogenes. Choroid plexus carcinomas (CPC) are poorly understood and frequently lethal brain tumors with minimal treatment options.      Using a new mouse model of the disease and a large cohort of human CPCs [GSE60892; GSE60899], we performed a cross-species, genome-wide search for novel oncogenes within syntenic regions of chromosome gain.      TAF12, NFYC and RAD54L, co-located on human chromosome 1p32-35.3 and mouse chromosome 4qD1-D3, were identified as oncogenes that are gained in tumors in both species and required to initiate and progress the disease in mice.      TAF12 and NFYC are transcription factors that regulate the epigenome, while RAD54L plays a central role in DNA repair.      Our data identify a group of concurrently gained, novel oncogenes that cooperate in the formation of CPC and unmask potential new avenues for therapy.     CPC mouse model samples of tumors derived from choroid plexus epithelium (CPE) cells that are Tp53/RB/Pten null in FVB mice.     Female CD1 nude (host) mice were transfected with postanatal CPE and compared with a  medulloblastoma normal mouse embryonic,  postnatal and adult controls (loxP TP53/RB/PTEN (no Cre)) Implanted and reimplanted are from the orthotropic transplants of the primary tumor or later tumors
 E-GEOD-20987 - Gene expression data of BCR-ABL1 transformed B cell precursors from BCL6 wild-type and BCL6 knockout mice To elucidate the mechanism of BCL6-mediated pre-B cell survival signaling, we investigated the gene expression pattern in BCR-ABL1-transformed BCL6+/+ and BCL6-/- B cell precursors.     Pharmacological inhibition of BCR-ABL1 was performed with the BCR-ABL1 kinase inhibitor STI571 (Imatinib).  BCR-ABL1 transformed B cell precursors of BCL6 wildtype and BCL6 knockout mice were either treated with 10µM STI571 (Imatinib) for 16 hours or cultured in absence of STI571. Three samples for each condition were processed.
 E-GEOD-10871 - Transcription profiling of mouse differentiated, partially- and fully-reprogrammed MEFs/B-cells Expression profiles generated during dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying direct reprogramming of somatic cells to a pluripotent state (induced pluripotent stem cells, iPS).  Experiment Overall Design: 2 technical replicates of B lymphocytes, partially reprogrammed (MCV8, MCV6, BIV1), MEF-iPS(Oct4) and B-iPS(Nanog) cell lines.
 E-GEOD-22637 - Expression file from FGF-10 experiment Differentiating embryonic stem cells into cardiomyocytes is inefficient, and we discover that FGF-10 can induce embryonic stem cells differentiation into cardiomyocytes.     We use microarray to gain insight into the global gene expression and elucidate the machenism that FGF-10 induces embryonic stem cells differentiation into cardiomyocytes.     Two-day embryoid bodies were treated with or without 100 ng/ml FGF10 and RNA was obtained 24 hours later and hybridized by Affymetrix microarray
 E-GEOD-11018 - Transcription profiling of mouse inducible BMPR2 mutant vs. controls in lung with and without elevated RVSP Familial pulmonary arterial hypertension (fPAH) is associated with mutations in BMPR2. Many of these mutations occur in the BMPR2 tail domain, leaving the SMAD functions intact.     In order to determine the in vivo consequences of BMPR2 tail domain mutation, we created a smooth-muscle specific doxycycline inducible BMPR2 mutation with an arginine to termination mutation at amino acid 899. When these SM22-rtTA x TetO7-BMPR2R899X mice had transgene induced for 9 weeks, starting at 4 weeks of age, they universally developed pulmonary vascular pruning as assessed by fluorescent microangiography.     Approximately half the time the induced animals developed elevated right ventricular systolic pressures (RVSP), associated with extensive pruning, muscularization of small pulmonary vessels, and development of large structural pulmonary vascular changes.     These lesions included large numbers of macrophages and T-cells in their adventitial compartment, as well as CD133 positive cells in the lumen.     Small vessels filled with CD45 positive and sometimes CD3 positive cells were a common feature in all SM22-rtTA x TetO7-BMPR2R899X mice.     Gene array experiments show changes in stress response, muscle organization and function, proliferation and apoptosis, and developmental pathways before RVSP increases.     Our results show that the primary phenotypic result of BMPR2 tail domain mutation in smooth muscle is pulmonary vascular pruning leading to elevated RVSP, associated with early dysregulation in multiple pathways with clear relevance to PAH. This model should be useful to the research community in examining early molecular and physical events in the development of PAH, and as a platform to validate potential treatments.     Experiment Overall Design: Each array is an individual female mouse, age-matched, with two mice & arrays used for each of controls (transactivator only), BMPR2-R899X with normal RVSP, and BMPR2-R899X with high RVSP.
 E-GEOD-39082 - Expression data from cultured c-Kit+Sca-1+Lin- (KSL)cells The Notch signaling pathway plays a critical role in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of stem and progenitor cells including hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Notch receptors and ligands are expressed in BM stromal and hematopoietic cells.     A large body of evidence has demonstrated that activating Notch signaling enhances HSCs self-renewal and facilitates its expansion ex vivo.     We report that an endothelium-targeted soluble Notch ligand, the DSL domain of mouse Delta-like 1 fused with a RGD motif (mD1R), efficiently promotes the expansion ex vivo of mouse bone marrow HSPCs in a Notch signaling and endocytosis dependent manner.     HSPCs expanded in the presence of mD1R kept long-term HSPC repopulation capacity.     We used microarrays to  compare the gene expression profiles of HSPCs expanded  in the presence of PBS and mD1R. KSL cells were plated on Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and cultured in a serum-free medium supplemented with a cocktail containing 5 types of mouse cytokines (m5GF) in the presence of PBS or mD1R for 7 days.     Then KSL cells were sorted from these cultured hematopoietic cells for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.     The experiments were repeated 3 times.
 E-GEOD-20282 - Gfi1 regulates survival and lineage commitment of hematopoietic precursors and prevents myeloproliferative diseases Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and lymphoid-primed multi-potential progenitors (LMPPs) are able to initiate both lymphoid and myeloid differentiation.     We show here that the transcriptional repressor Gfi1 (growth factor independence 1) implements a specific gene expression program in HSCs and LMPPs that is critical for their survival and lymphoid differentiation potential.     We present evidence that Gfi1 is required to maintain expression of genes involved in lymphoid development such as Flt-3, IL7R, Ebf1, Rag1, CCR9 and Notch1 and controls myeloid lineage commitment  by regulating expression of genes such as Hoxa9 or M-CSFR. Gfi1 also inhibits apoptosis in HSCs by repressing pro-apoptotic genes such as Bax or Bak. As a consequence, Gfi1-/- mice show defects in self renewal, survival and both myeloid and lymphoid development of HSCs and LMPPs. Co-expression of a Bcl-2 transgene can partially restore the function of HSCs in Gfi1-/- mice, but not the defects in early lymphoid development.     Of interest, Gfi1-/- x Bcl-2 transgenic mice show an accelerated expansion of myeloid cells and succumb to a fatal myeloproliferative disease resembling chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Our data show that Gfi1 protects HSCs against apoptosis, ensures the proper development of LMPPs and plays a role in the development of myeloid leukemia.     We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression changes following knockout of Gfi1 in mouse LSK cells We compared LSK cells isolated from Gfi1 knockout mice with wildtype cells to determine global gene expression changes by microarray analysis
 E-GEOD-52101 - Transcript abundance comparison between BALB/c ears inoculated with Leishmania mexicana and Leishmania mexicana plus promastigote secretory gel (PSG) To determine the modulation of gene expression of  Leishmania mexicana(M379)-inoculated BALB/c ears  in the presence of promastigote secretory gel (PSG) A genome-wide transcriptional analysis was performed by comparing the gene expression profiles of Leishmania mexicana- inoculated BALB/c ears and Leishmania mexicana plus PSG BALB/c ears.      Leishmania mexicana amastigotes were purified from mouse cutaneous lesions and transformed in vitro in metacycic promastigotes (MT). After 6, 24 and 48 hours, ears were collected and processed for RNA extraction.     Three Biological replicates per condition were run.
 E-GEOD-67593 - Quiescence of Memory CD8+ T Cells Is Mediated by Regulatory T Cells through Inhibitory Receptor CTLA-4 Immune memory cells are poised to rapidly expand and elaborate effector functions upon reinfection.     However, despite heightened readiness to respond, memory cells exist in a functionally quiescent state.     The paradigm is that memory cells remain inactive due to lack of TCR stimuli.      Here we report a unique role of Tregs in orchestrating memory quiescence by inhibiting effector and proliferation programs through CTLA-4. Loss of Tregs resulted in activation of genome-wide transcriptional programs characteristic of potent effectors, and both developing and established memory quickly reverted to a terminally differentiated (KLRG-1hi/IL-7R±lo/GzmBhi) phenotype, with compromised metabolic fitness, longevity, polyfunctionality and protective efficacy.     CTLA-4, an inhibitory receptor overexpressed on Tregs, functionally replaced Tregs in trans to rescue Treg-less memory defects and restore homeostasis of secondary mediators as well.     These studies present CD28-CTLA-4-CD80/CD86 axis as a novel target to potentially accelerate vaccine-induced immunity and improve T-cell memory quality in current cancer immunotherapies proposing transient Treg-depletion.      We used microarray analysis to detail the global programming of gene expression in LCMV GP33-specific CD8 T cells differentiated in the presence or absence of regulatory T cells Differentiation of memory CD8 T cells entails a progressive transition of highly activated effector program to a quiescent memory program.     A key question in the field is to understand the factors that aid in the differentiation of memory cells from effector cells.     It is a generally accepted paradigm that effector cells transition to a memory state by default after antigen clearance, since TCR stimuli is the key driver of effector programs in CD8 T cells.     We hypothesized that the effector to memory transition of CD8 T cells involves active immunological brakes through regulatory T cells (Tregs) that allow the highly activated effector cells to convert into quiescent memory cells.     To address this hypothesis, we used FoxP3-DTR mice to deplete Tregs during the window following antigen clearance, during which the effector CD8 T cells convert to long-lived memory cells.     To get a deeper understanding of the global transcriptome of CD8 T cells as they transition from an effector to a memory state, we isolated and arrayed the antigen-specific CD8 T cells at day 16 post-infection that have experienced the transitional environment with and without the presence of Tregs.
 E-GEOD-6443 - Transcription profiling of jejunums from wild type and Klf9-/- mice to investigate the involvement of Klf9 in small intestine crypt-villus cell renewal and lineage determination. Kruppel-like factor 9 (Klf9), a zinc-finger transcription factor, is implicated in the control of cell proliferation, cell differentiation and cell fate in brain and uterus.      Using Klf9 null mutant mice, we have investigated the involvement of Klf9 in small intestine crypt-villus cell renewal and lineage determination.      We report the predominant expression of Klf9 gene in small intestine smooth muscle (muscularis externa).  Jejunums null for Klf9 have shorter villi, reduced crypt stem/transit cell proliferation, and altered lineage determination as indicated by decreased and increased numbers of Goblet and Paneth cells, respectively.      A stimulatory role for Klf9 in villus cell migration was demonstrated by BrdU labeling.      Results suggest that Klf9 controls the elaboration, from small intestine smooth muscle, of molecular mediator(s) of crypt cell proliferation and lineage determination, and of villus cell migration.              Experiment Overall Design: Total RNA was extracted in parallel from the jejunums of five WT and five Klf9-/- male mice (PND 30) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).  Conversion of each RNA preparation to corresponding fragmented cRNA.  Fifteen ug of each cRNA was hybridized for 16 hours to an Affymetrix mouse 430A GeneChip.      Ten GeneChips (each corresponding to a single animal) were hybridized, washed and scanned in parallel.      Following the wash, signal amplification, and signal detection steps, GeneChips were scanned (Agilent GeneArray laser scanner) and the resultant images quantified using Affymetrix MAS 5.0 software.
 E-GEOD-19517 - Gene expression profiling of conditional ablation of Indian hedgehog in the mouse uterus Conditional ablation of Indian hedgehog (Ihh) in the murine uterus results in mice that are sterile due to defects in embryo implantation.      We performed microarray analysis on these mice at the time point at which the Ihh target genes are induced by the administration of exogenous hormone to mimic day 3.5 of pregnancy.      This analysis identified 863 genes altered by the conditional ablation of Ihh.  Of these, genes that regulated the cell cycle were overrepresented.      In addition, genes involved in epidermal growth factor (EGF) and estrogen (E2) signaling were found to be deregulated upon Ihh ablation.      Furthermore, upon conditional ablation of Ihh, 15 month old mice exhibited hallmarks of estrogenized uteri such as cystically dilated glands and hyalinized stroma.     Thus, Ihh regulates embryo implantation by impacting the cell cycle, EGF signaling, and E2 signaling.      Keywords: two group comparison We conditionally ablated Indian hedgehog in the mouse uterus using the PRcre mouse model  (PRcre/+Ihhf/f; Ihhd/d). High density DNA microarray analysis was performed on Day -1 of the artificial decidual response on Ihhf/f and Ihhd/d uteri.
 E-GEOD-19225 - Mouse Prostate Developmental Timecourse Studies centered at the intersection of embryogenesis and carcinogenesis have identified striking parallels involving signaling pathways that modulate both developmental and neoplastic processes.     In the prostate, reciprocal interactions between epithelium and stroma are known to influence neoplasia and also exert morphogenic effects via the urogenital sinus mesenchyme.     In this study, we sought to determine molecular relationships between aspects of normal prostate development and prostate carcinogenesis.     We first characterized the gene expression program associated with key points of murine prostate organogenesis spanning the initial in utero induction of prostate budding through maturity.     We identified a highly reproducible temporal program of gene expression that partitioned according to the broad developmental stages of prostate induction, branching morphogenesis, and secretory differentiation.     Comparisons of gene expression profiles of murine prostate cancers arising in the context of genetically engineered alterations in the Pten tumor suppressor and Myc oncogene identified significant associations between the profile of branching morphogenesis and both cancer models.     Further, the expression of genes comprising the branching morphogenesis program, such as PRDX4, SLC43A1, and DNMT3A, was significantly altered in human neoplastic prostate epithelium.     These results indicate that components of normal developmental processes are active in prostate neoplasia and provide further rationale for exploiting molecular features of organogenesis to understand cancer phenotypes.     Whole male UGS (E14.5, E15.5, E16.5, and E17.5) or separated prostate lobes (P7, P30, and DP90) were dissected from C57BL6/J mice and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.     For each biological replication, we pooled 3 to 10 mice representing one or two litters.     RNA from pools of UGS or specific prostate lobes (vp, ap, and dlp) was prepared using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit.     We included an on-column DNaseI treatment to remove contaminating DNA. Before RNA amplification, we combined equal quantities of RNA from vp, ap, and dlp for the postnatal prostate samples.     We amplified 1 ug of total RNA from each sample through one round using the Arcturus RiboAmp kit.     For the E14.5 UGS reference sample, a second round of amplification was done to provide enough RNA for all microarrays.     Each developmental sample was hybridized against the E14.5 UGS reference sample with a dye swap, for a total of 42 arrays.

Raw data was not affected.
 E-GEOD-75808 - Differential Ly6C Expression after Renal Ischemia-Reperfusion Identifies Unique Macrophage Populations Macrophages are a heterogeneous cell type implicated in injury, repair, and fibrosis after AKI, but the macrophage population associated with each phase is unclear.results of this study in a renal ischemia-reperfusion injury model allow phenotype and function to be assigned to CD11b+/Ly6C+ monocyte/macrophage populations in the pathophysiology of disease after AKI. we used a renal bilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury mouse model to identify unique monocyte/macrophage populations by differential expression of Ly6C in CD11b+ cells and to define the function of these cells in the pathophysiology of disease on the basis of microarray gene signatures and reduction strategies Macrophage populations were sorted by Flow Cytometry into low and intermediate populations by Itgam(Cd11b) and Ly6c markers.     The cells obtained in 5 weeks sham, 5 weeks IR, 9 day sham, and 9 day IR with 6 samples per group (3 int and 3 low). Cells were sorted in 350ul of RLT lysing buffer and kept at -80c until RNA extraction.Sample amplification, fragmentation, hybridization,washing and scanning were performed according to validated Affymetrix protocol in a CLIA certified lab.
 E-GEOD-30966 - Gene expression profiling of uterine stromal cells isolated from Msx1Msx2 floxed and Msx1Msx2 ablated mice on day 4 of pregnancy Our preliminary study revealed that the homeobox transcription factors, Msx1 and Msx2, are expressed in the mouse uterus during early pregnancy.     Further, conditional deletion of Msx1 and Msx2 in mouse uterus leads to implantation failure due to impaired uterine epithelial receptivity.     To identify the downstream targets of Msx1Msx2 in the uterus, we performed gene expression profling of uterine stromal cells isolated from Msx1Msx2-null mice and the corresponding controls on day4 of pregnancy (the time of implantation). The microarray results revealed elevated expression of mRNAs corresponding to several members of the fibroblast growth factor family and Wnts in uterine stroma of Msx1Msx2-ablated mice.     We performed conditional ablation of Msx1Msx2 in the mouse uterus using the PRcre mouse model.     we isolated uterine stromal cells from day4 pregnant mice (n=5 for each genotype), purified total RNA from these cells, pooled these samples and then hybridized to high density affymetrix microarrays.
 E-CBIL-15 - Transcription profiling of mouse pancreatic duct cell lines infected with Ngn3-expressing adenovirus We have developed an in vitro model of Ngn3-dependent differentiation by infecting pancreatic duct cell lines with an Ngn3-expressing adenovirus.     We used glass microarrays containing 18,000 mouse cDNAs and compared gene expression patterns in mPAC L20 cells infected with either AdCMV-gal (control) or AdCMV-ngn3. All comparisons were performed 48 h after viral infection, meaning that genes differentially expressed in Ngn3-expressing mPAC cells could include genes whose expression was directly or indirectly controlled by Ngn3.
 E-GEOD-19282 - The Effects of Globin on Microarray-based Gene Expression Analysis of Mouse Blood Peripheral whole blood-based gene expression profiling has become one of the most common strategies exploited in the development of clinically relevant biomarkers.      However, the ability to identify biologically meaningful conclusions from gene expression patterns in whole blood is highly problematic.     First, it is difficult to know whether or not expression patterns in whole blood capture those in primary tissues.      Second, if explicit steps are not taken to accommodate the extremely elevated expression levels of globin in blood then large-scale multi-probe microarray-based studies can be severely compromised.      Many studies consider the use of mouse blood as a model for human blood in addition to considering blood gene expression levels as a general surrogate for gene expression levels in other tissues.      We explored the effects of globin reduction on peripheral mouse blood in the detection of genes known to be expressed in human tissues.       Globin reduction resulted in 1.) a significant increase in the number of probes detected (5840 ± 944 vs 12411 ± 1904); 2.) increased expression for 4128 probe sets compared to non-globin reduced blood (p   .001, ≥ two-fold); 3.) improved detection of genes associated with many biological pathways and diseases; and 4.) an increased ability to detect genes expressed in 27 human tissues (p   10-4).  This study suggests that although microarray-based mouse blood gene expression studies that do not consider the effects of globin are severely compromised, globin-reduced mouse whole blood gene expression studies can be used to capture the expression profiles of genes known to contribute to various human diseases.     Whole and GLOBINclear-treated paired blood samples from 18 mice representing 3 mice from 6 different isogenic mice strains.
 E-GEOD-12430 - Transcription profiling of mouse conditional knockout of patched (mouse model of medulloblastoma) to investigate the control initiation and progression of murine medulloblastomas resulting from loss of patched We are examining the genes that control initiation and progression of murine medulloblastomas that result from loss of patched.     Approximately 25% of human medulloblastomas have mutations in patched or in other elements of the sonic hedgehog pathway.     However, the cells from which these tumors originate (neural progenitors or stem cells), the cells that are responsible for tumor propagation (cancer stem cells), and the genes that are required for tumor progression are poorly understood.     To address these questions, we have developed conditional patched knockout mice in which the gene is deleted in neural stem cells or progenitors.     In addition, we have isolated a population of tumor-propagating cells from these tumors.     By studying these models we will gain insight into the mechanisms of tumorigenesis and identify new targets for therapy.     To identify the molecular mechanisms that underlie tumor initiation and propagation, we will compare gene expression in tumors resulting from loss of patched in neural stem cells vs. progentors, and in cancer stem cells vs. non-cancer stem cells.     We hypothesize that medulloblastomas initiated in neural stem cells (using GFAP-Cre) are more aggressive than those initiated in neural progenitors (using Math1-Cre), and will express more genes associated with self-renewal.     In addition, we hypothesize that cancer stem cells (CD15+ cells) from a given tumor will express higher levels of self-renewal genes than non-stem cells (CD15- cells) from the same tumor.     Cells from 5 GFAP-Cre tumors, 5 Math1-Cre tumors, and 5 conventional patched-knockout tumors will be isolated using enzymatic digestion and Percoll gradient centrifugation.     These procedures have been found to result in 85-95% pure tumor cell populations.     In addition, 5 tumors will be FACS-sorted to isolate CD15+ and CD15- populations.     RNA will be prepared from each of these samples using an RNeasy kit from Qiagen.     Samples of 2 micrograms will be resuspended in 10 microliters of RNase-free water, and sent to the Consortium for labeling, hybridization and analysis.     Cells from the three types of tumors, and CD15+ and CD15- cells,  will be compared to one another.
 E-GEOD-74653 - The transcription factor BACH2 is required to establish immunosuppression within tumors Through a diversity of functional lineages, cells of the innate and adaptive immune system either drive or constrain immune reactions within tumors.     Thus, while the immune system has a powerful ability to recognize and kill cancer cells, this function is often suppressed preventing clearance of disease.     The transcription factor (TF) BACH2 controls the differentiation and function of multiple innate and adaptive immune lineages, but its role in regulating tumor immunity is not known.     Here, we demonstrate that BACH2 is required to establish immunosuppression within tumors.     We found that growth of subcutaneously implanted tumors was markedly impaired in Bach2-deficient mice and coincided with intratumoral activation of both innate and adaptive immunity but was dependent upon adaptive immunity.     Analysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in Bach2-deficient mice revealed high frequencies of CD4+ and CD8+ effector cells expressing the inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ. Lymphocyte activation coincided with reduction in the frequency of intratumoral CD4+ Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells.     Mechanistically, Treg-dependent inhibition of CD8+ T cells was required for BACH2-mediated tumor immunosuppression.     These findings demonstrate that BACH2 is a key component of the molecular programme of tumor immunosuppression and identify a new target for development of therapies aimed at reversing immunosuppression in cancer.     Analysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in Bach2-deficient mice revealed high frequencies of CD4+ and CD8+ effector cells expressing the inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ. Lymphocyte activation coincided with reduction in the frequency of intratumoral CD4+ Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells.     Mechanistically, Treg-dependent inhibition of CD8+ T cells was required for BACH2-mediated tumor immunosuppression.
 E-GEOD-60506 - Expression data from cardiac CD11c+MHC II+ cells We previously reported that a synthetic Nod1 ligand, FK565, induced coronary arteritis in mice similar to Kawasaki disease.     However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this site-specific inflammation have remained elusive.     In this study, we found that CD11c+MHC class II+ cells accumulated in the heart of FK565-treated mice prior to arteritis development.     We used microarray analysis to detail gene expression of CD11c+MHC class II+ cells.     To obtain gene expression profile of CD11c+MHC class II+ cells, we isolated these cells from hearts of FK565-treated mice.     Briefly, female mice at 8weeks age were administered 500 μg of FK565 subcutaneously at day 0 and day 3. At day6, murine hearts were removed and digested with collagenase.     CD11c+MHC II+ cells were sorted as PI–CD45+Ly6G–NK1.1–CD11b+CD11c+MHC II+ using FACS Aria cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Sorted cells were subjected to RNA preparation.     Two independent replicates from ten mice were made.
 E-MEXP-1968 - Transcription profiling by array of mouse wild type and DNA-repair-deficient primary dermal fibroblasts after treatment with ultraviolet radiation Transcription profiling of wild type and DNA repair-deficient cells upon exposure to ultraviolet irradiation.
 E-GEOD-18204 - FL5.12 Bfl-1DC/p53DD-derived splenic tumors compared to the parental FL5.12 Bfl-1DC/p53DD cell line The antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bfl-1 is upregulated in many human tumors in which NF-kB is implicated, and contributes significantly to tumor cell survival and chemoresistance.     We previously found that NF-kB induces transcription of bfl-1, and that the Bfl-1 protein is also regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome.     However little is known of the role that dysregulation of Bfl-1 turnover plays in cancer.     We found that ubiquitination-resistant mutants of Bfl-1 display increased stability and greatly accelerate tumor formation in a mouse model of leukemia/lymphoma.     Gene expression profiling revealed that tyrosine kinase Lck is highly upregulated and activated in these tumors compared to the parental cells, as were several genes in the RANK signaling pathway, and leads to activation of the IKK, Akt and Erk signaling pathways, which are key mediators in cancer.     Tumor assays with cells coexpressing constitutively active Lck with Bfl-1, or with tumor-derived cells following shRNA-mediated Lck knockdown, unveiled functional cooperation between Bfl-1 and Lck in leukemia/lymphomagenesis.     These data demonstrate that ubiquitination is a critical mechanism for regulating Bfl-1 function, and suggest that mutations in bfl-1 or in the signaling pathways that control its ubiquitination may predispose to cancer.     Additionally since bfl-1 is upregulated in many human hematopoietic tumors, these data suggest that strategies to promote Bfl-1 ubiquitination may improve therapy in drug-resistant tumors.     FL5.12 pro-B cells were stably transfected with Bfl-1DC and p53DD (Parental - P) and injected i.v. into nude mice.      The spleens were harvested from three independent mice that developed leukemia/lymphoma (T1, T2, and T3).  To identify the changes in gene expression that occurred during tumorigenesis, RNA was isolated from the parental cell line (P) and from  three independent splenic tumors (T) and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 arrays.      The analysis was performed in duplicate.
 E-MTAB-1831 - Transcription profiling by array of epididymal adipose tissue from male hemizygous fat-1(+/-) transgenic mice and their wild-type littermates, all fed with a high-fat diet Dietary administration of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is often associated with altered adipose tissue (AT) morphology and/or function in obese mice.     However, it is unclear whether these observations are an indirect consequence of reduced weight gain or result from direct actions of n-3 PUFA. Here we studied the AT of fat-1 transgenic mice that convert endogenous n-6 to n-3 PUFA. These mice display equivalent weight gain and fat accretion to their wild-type (WT) counterparts.     We performed Affymetrix microarray in epididymal AT of male hemizygous fat-1(+/-) transgenic mice and their wild type littermates that had been fed high fat diets from 6 weeks of age (diet-93075, 55% Kcal from fat, Harlan Teklad). Mice were sacrificed after 8 weeks on the HF diet.     At sacrifice epididymal adipose tissues excised for the microarray study (n=3 per group) were rapidly homogenized in QIAZOL (QIAGEN) and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.
 E-GEOD-41809 - Expression data from young (4 month-old) hearts from GRK2 heterozygous C57BL/6J mice and its wild type littermates G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) has emerged as a key regulator of cardiac function and myocardial structure.     Cardiac GRK2 is increased in heart failure and ischemia in humans, whereas genetic inhibition of GRK2 is cardioprotective in animal models of these pathologies.     However, the mechanistic basis underlying these effects are not fully understood.     We have used adult GRK2 hemizygous mice (GRK2+/-) as a model to assess the effects of a sustained systemic inhibition of GRK2 in heart tissue with age.     We used microarrays to determine the global programme of gene expression underlying cardioprotection in GRK2 hemizygous mice.     4 month-old mice hearts were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
 E-GEOD-62013 - Diabetes and Insulin in Regulation of Brain Cholesterol Metabolism The brain is the most cholesterol-rich organ in the body, most of which comes from in situ synthesis.     Here we demonstrate that in insulin-deficient diabetic mice, there is a reduction in expression of the major transcriptional regulator of cholesterol metabolism, SREBP-2, and its downstream genes in the hypothalamus and other areas of the brain, leading to a reduction in brain cholesterol synthesis and synaptosomal cholesterol content.     These changes are due, at least in part, to direct effects of insulin to regulate these genes in neurons and glial cells and can be corrected by intracerebroventricular injections of insulin.     Knockdown of SREBP-2 in cultured neurons causes a decrease in markers of synapse formation and reduction of SREBP-2 in the hypothalamus of mice using shRNA results in increased feeding and weight gain.     Thus, insulin and diabetes can alter brain cholesterol metabolism, and this may play an important role in the neurologic and metabolic dysfunction observed in diabetes and other disease states.     Hypothalamus was compared between streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic, ob/ob, and control mice, with 5-6 replicates per goup.
 E-GEOD-34729 - Gene expression changes induced by overexpression of EVI1 in Lin- hematopoietic cells [Lin] The transcription factor Evi1 is essential for the formation and maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells, and induces clonal dominance with malignant progression upon constitutive activation by chromosomal rearrangements or transgene integration events.     To understand the immediate and adaptive response of primary murine hematopoietic cells to the transcriptional upregulation of Evi1, we developed an inducible lentiviral vector system with a robust expression switch.     We found that Evi1 delays differentiation and promotes survival in myeloid culture conditions, orchestrating a battery of genes involved in stemness (Aldh1a1, Ly6a [Sca1], Abca1, Epcam, among others). Importantly, Evi1 suppresses Cyclins and Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk), while it upregulates Cdk inhibitors, inducing quiescence in various proliferation-inducing cytokine conditions and operating in a strictly dose-dependent manner.     Hematopoietic cells with persisting Evi1-induction tend to adopt a relatively low expression level.     We thus classify Evi1 as a dormancy-inducing oncogene, likely requiring epigenetic and genetic compensation for cell expansion and malignant progression.     Lin- Rosa26rtTA cells were isolated, transduced in S3F11 cytokines, induced the next day with DOX [1 μg/ml] and  20 hours later sorted for negative/low or highly EGFP expressing cells, from which total RNA was extraced and subjected to Microarray Analysis
 E-GEOD-31013 - Transcription profiling by array of spontaneous lung tumors in mice to compare to human non-small cell lung cancer Introduction: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in people.     There are several chemically induced and genetically modified mouse models used to study lung cancer.     We hypothesized that spontaneous murine (B6C3F1) lung tumors can serve as a model to study human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).    Methods: RNA was extracted from untreated 2-year-old B6C3F1 mouse spontaneous lung (SL) tumors and age-matched normal lung tissue from a chronic inhalation NTP study.     Global gene expression analysis was performed using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 GeneChip® arrays.     After data normalization, for each probe set, pairwise comparisons between groups were made using a bootstrap t-test while controlling the mixed directional false discovery rate (mdFDR) to generate a differential gene expression list.     IPA, KEGG, and EASE software tools were used to evaluate the overrepresented cancer genes and pathways.         Results: MAPK and TGF-beta pathways were overrepresented within the dataset.     Almost all of the validated genes by quantitative real time RT-PCR had comparable directional fold changes with the microarray data.     The candidate oncogenes included Kras, Braf, Raf1, Id2, Hmga1, Cks1b, and Foxf1. The candidate tumor suppressor genes included Rb1, Cdkn2a, Hnf4a, Tcf21, Ptprd, Hpgd, Hopx, Ogn, Id4, Hoxa5, Smad6, Smad7, Zbtb16, Cyr61, Dusp4, and Ifi16. In addition, several genes important in lung development were also differentially expressed, such as Smad6, Hopx, Sox4, Sox9 and Mycn.         Conclusion: In this study, we have demonstrated that several cancer genes and signaling pathways relevant for human NSCLC were similarly altered in spontaneous murine lung tumors.     Six spontaneous lung tumors and six normal lungs (as controls) from 2-year-old B6C3F1 mice.
 E-GEOD-25125 - PPARg and IL-4-induced gene expression data from PPARg +/- LysCre and PPARg fl/- LysCre mouse bone marrow-derived alternatively activated macrophages and immature dendritic cells (iDCs) Conditional macrophage-specific PPARg knockout mice were generated on C57Bl/6 background by breeding PPARg fl/- (one allele is floxed, the other is null) and lysozyme Cre transgenic mice.     PPARg and IL-4 signaling was analyzed on bone marrow-derived macrophages.     Bone marrow of 4 mice per group was isolated and differentiated to alternatively activated macrophages with 20 ng/ml M-CSF and 20 ng/ml IL-4 or to iDCs with 20 ng/ml GM-CSF+20 ng/ml IL-4. 1 uM Rosiglitazone (RSG) was used to activate PPARg. From each mouse 4 samples were generated: 1. M-CSF+IL-4, 2. M-CSF+IL-4+RSG, 3. GM-CSF+IL-4 and 4. GM-CSF+IL-4+RSG. All compounds were added throughout the whole differentiation process, and fresh media was added every other day.     Control cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO:ethanol). After 9 days, RNA was isolated and gene expression profiles were analyzed using ABI Mouse Genome Survey Arrays.     4 PPARg +/- LysCre and 4 PPARg fl/- LysCre mice were used to isolate bone marrow and from each alternatively activated macrophages were differentiated with IL-4 and simultaneously treated with vehicle or RSG, iDCs were differentiated with GM-CSF+IL-4 and simultaneously treated with vehicle or RSG. Altogether we analyzed 32 samples with 4 biological replicates as below.

 E-GEOD-58513 - Uromodulin-retention in thick ascending limb affects SCD1 in neighboring S3 proximal tubule in males: transcriptome studies in mouse models of Uromodulin-associated kidney disease Uromodulin-associated kidney disease (UAKD) summarizes different clinical features of an autosomal dominant heritable disease syndrome in humans with a proven uromodulin (UMOD) mutation involved.     It is often characterized by hyperuricemia, gout, alteration of urine concentrating ability, as well as a variable rate of disease progression inconstantly leading to renal failure and histological alterations of the kidneys.     We recently established the two Umod mutant mouse lines UmodC93F and UmodA227T on the C3H inbred genetic background both showing kidney defects analogous to those found in human UAKD patients.     The aim of this study was the further analysis of the phenotypic alterations by examining the kidneys as primarily affected organs.     Transcriptome and quantitative PCR analyses as well as IHC analyses found significant changes related to the phenotyping changes.     4 male mice of each mutant cohort (Umod C93F & Umod A227T) and the corresponding wildtype controls, each mutant mouse was compared to the mean of the corresponding wildtype including a technical replicate (dye swap)
 E-GEOD-59018 - DIRECT CONVERSION OF FIBROBLASTS INTO FUNCTIONAL ASTROCYTES BY DEFINED TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS Direct cell reprogramming has enabled the direct conversion of skin fibroblasts into functional neurons and oligodendrocytes using a minimal set of cell lineage-specific transcription factors.     This approach has substantial advantages since it is rapid and simple, generating the cell type of interest in a single step.     However, it remains unknown whether this technology can be applied for directly reprogramming skin cells into astrocytes, the third neural lineage.     Astrocytes play crucial roles in neuronal homeostasis and their dysfunctions contribute to the origin and progression of multiple human diseases.     Herein, we carried out a screening using several transcription factors involved in defining the astroglial cell fate and identified NFIA, NFIB and SOX9 to be sufficient to convert with high efficiency embryonic and post-natal mouse fibroblasts into astrocytes (iAstrocytes). We proved both by gene expression profiling and functional tests that iAstrocytes are comparable to native brain astrocytes.     This protocol can be then employed to generate functional iAstrocytes for a wide range of experimental applications.     Induced astrocytes (iAstro) were compared to Fibroblasts (Fibro) as negative control and to primary astrocytes (astro) as positive control.     Three biological replicates were analyzed for each experimental group.
 E-GEOD-43197 - Natural cardiogenesis-based template predicts cardiogenic potential of induced pluripotent stem cell lines Rationale: Cardiac development is a complex process that results in the first integrated, multi-lineage embryonic tissue.     Imperfect developmental progression leads to congenital heart disease, the most common birth defect with developmental corruption affecting more than 1% of all live births.     Interrogation of individual genes has provided the backbone for cardiac developmental biology, yet a comprehensive transcriptome derived from natural cardiogenesis is required to establish an unbiased roadmap to gauge innate developmental milestones necessary for stem cell-based differentiation and in vitro disease modeling.      Objective: Establish a contextual expression database of spatial-temporal cardiac structures, and validate a predictive tool to diagnose and predict cardiogenic outcomes from individual pluripotent stem cell lines.      Methods and Results: Stage-specific cardiac structures were dissected from eight distinctive embryonic time points to produce a genome-wide expressome analysis across the spectrum of early to late cardiogenesis.     Hierarchical clustering of the time course dataset demonstrated discrete gene expression profiles during natural embryonic development.     In reference to the native cardiogenic expression roadmap, disruptive iPSC-derived cardiac expression profiles were revealed from pro-cardiogenic 3-factor (SOX2, OCT4, KLF4) compared to non-cardiogenic 4-factor (addition of c-MYC) reprogramming regimens upon stage-specific differentiation.     Expression of cardiac-related genes from 3F-iPSC differentiated in vitro at day 0, 5, and 11 recapitulated expression of natural embryos at days 0, E7.5-E8.5, and E14.5-E18.5, respectively.     In contrast, 4F-iPSC demonstrated variable gastrulation gene expression profiles beginning at day 5 of differentiation.     Differential gene expression within the pluripotent ground state between the archetypical high cardiogenic potential of embryonic stem cells recapitulated in 3F-iPSC vs. the low cardiogenic potential of 4F-iPSC revealed 23 distinguishing candidate genes.     Upon subsequent differentiation, cell line-specific gene expression differences were magnified to 399 genes at day 5 and 726 genes at day 11. A confirmed panel of 20 genes, differentially expressed between high and low cardiogenic cell lines, was transformed into a predictive score that was sufficient to correctly rank independent iPSC lines according to cardiogenic potential.      Conclusions: Transcriptome analysis attuned to the embryonic developing heart provides a robust platform to probe coordinated cardiac specification and maturation from stem cell-based cardiogenesis model systems.     Based on this genome-wide expressome roadmap, a panel of pre-cardiac genes was extracted that allowed differential prognosis of cardiogenic competency from individual reprogrammed cell lines at the pluripotent state.     The overall experimental design includes 3 time points (Day0, Day5, Day11) and 3 different stem cell lines: R1 embryonic stem cells (ESCs), H9 induced pluripotent stem cells (H9-iPSCs) generated/reprogrammed by 3 transcription factors (called 3F-iPSCs), and 19BL induced pluripotent stem cells (19BL-iPSCs) generated/reprogrammed by 4 transcription factors (called 4F-iPSC). At each time point, each cell line has 3 biological replicates.     In total, there are 27 samples.     R1-embryonic stem cells (R1-ESCs): Day0 undifferentiated ESCs - 3 biological replicates, Differentiated for 5 days (Day5) - 3 biological replicates, Differentiated for 11 days (Day11) - 3 biological replicates.     3F-iPSC (H9 iPSCs): Day 0 undifferentiated - 3 biological replicates, Differentiated for 5 days (Day5) - 3 biological replicates, Differentiated for 11 days (Day11) - 3 biological replicates.     4F-iPSC (19BL-iPSCs): Day0 undifferentiated - 3 biological replicates, Differentiated for 5 days (Day5) - 3 biological replicates, Differentiated for 11 days (Day11) - 3 biological replicates.
 E-GEOD-45513 - Mouse Spontaneous C3H/HeJ AA Skin Our goal was to develop a transcriptomic description of affected alopecic skin from aged C3H/HeJ mice.      Affected skin from 3 mice was compared to skin from similarly aged but unaffected C3H/HeJ mice.     3 biological replicates from 3 separate affected mice compared with 3 biological replicate controls from 3 unaffected mice
 E-MTAB-1156 - Transcription profiling by array of mouse male and female E11.5 SF1 GFP Pos to investigate the effect of the deletion of the Insulin receptor (InsR) and Igf1 receptor (Igf1R) we performed the analysis of SF1-GFP+ cells purified from mouse embryonic gonads at embryonic day E11.5 and analyzed the effect of the deletion of the Insulin receptor (InsR) and Igf1 receptor (Igf1R) by comparing double mutant and control, in male and female.
 E-GEOD-35366 - Global developmental gene expression and pathway analysis of normal brain development and mouse models of human neuronal migration defects Proper cortical development relies on the balance of neuronal migration and proliferation.     We investigated the gene expression differences of mouse knock-outs for Lissencephaly in humans.     Our analysis suggests that gene expression and pathway analysis in mouse models of a similar disorder or within a common pathway can be used to define novel candidates for related human diseases.     We investigated the developing brain of four mutants and wild-type mice using expression microarrays, bioinformatic analyses, and in vivo/in vitro experiments to address whether mutations in different members of the LIS1 neuronal migration complex lead to similar and/or distinct global gene expression alterations.

 E-MEXP-733 - Transcription profiling of skeletal muscle from wild type and Nebulin knock-out mice Knock out of the Nebulin gene.     We compared the Quadriceps of two Nebulin -deficient vs. 2 Wildtype mice.     The two KO-WT pairs derived from two litters (F2 generation, background: C57/Bl6 and 129/IB10).
 E-GEOD-7762 - Transcription profiling of mouse striatum treated with morphine, animals from four inbred strains Chronic opiate use produces molecular and cellular adaptations in the nervous system, leading to tolerance, physical dependence and addiction.     Genome-wide comparison of morphine-induced changes in brain transcription of mouse strains with different opioid-related phenotypes provides an opportunity to discover the relationship between gene expression and behavioral response to the drug.      Experiment Overall Design: Microarray experiment was designed to determine the impact of genetic background on the transcriptional effects of morphine in the striatum.     The effects of single (20 mg/kg, s.c.) and repeated morphine administration (10-40 mg/kg, 3 times daily for 5 days) were analyzed in four inbred mouse strains (129P3/J. DBA/2J, C57BL/6J, SWR/J). Twelve experimental groups were compared.     Control animals received injections of saline.     Three independent biological replicates of the microarray were prepared for each experimental group.     For each array, independent pools of total RNA from three animals were prepared.
 E-GEOD-12863 - An Ets2-specific transcriptional program in tumor-associated macrophages promotes metastasis Macrophages have been implicated in breast cancer progression and metastasis, but relatively little is known about the genes and pathways that are involved.      Using a conditional allele of Ets2 in the mouse, we have identified Ets2 as a critical gene in tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) that specifically promotes mammary tumor metastasis.      Loss of Ets2 in TAMs decreased the frequency and size of lung metastases without impacting primary tumor burden.      Expression profiling of isolated tumor macrophages established that Ets2 deficiency resulted in the de-repression of a defined set of anti-angiogenic genes.     Activation of this transcriptional program correlated with decreased angiogenesis in metastatic tumors and decreased metastatic growth.      Comparison of this Ets2-specific TAM expression profile with human breast cancer profiles revealed a macrophage gene expression signature that could predict overall survival of estrogen receptor negative patients.      In summary, we have identified a critical factor, Ets2, in TAMs that represses a transcriptional program to promote the growth of mammary tumor metastases in the lung.     Breast TAMs were isolated from early-stage PyMT-induced mammary tumors expressing Ets2 and also from the tumors with Ets2-deficient TAMs. Since macrophages have also been implicated in normal mammary gland remodeling, normal remeodeling macrophages were also purified from females expressing Ets2 and the ones where Ets2 is deleted in the macrophages.     One RNA sample was extracted from each genetic group for gene-expression profiling.
 E-MEXP-1406 - Transcription profiling by array of mice with diet-induced obesity treated with a locked-nucleic-acid-modified oligonucleotide (LNA-antimiR) which antagonises liver-expressed miR-122 Effect of miR-122 silencing in diet induced obese mice.
 E-GEOD-12930 - Transcription profiling of mouse lung tissue after exposure to mainstream tobacco smoke We have examined the impact of subchronic levels of tobacoo smoke on murine lungs.     We have used high density DNA microarray and analysed lung tissues from mice exposed to mainstream tobacco smoke (MTS). Our results reveal induction of inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) and its antagonist suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS3) mRNA in smoking group.     We also show that these changes are transient and are reversed completely after a period of cessation of smoking.     Experiment Overall Design: Male C57B1/CBA mice were exposed to MTS from two cigarettes daily, 5 days/week for 6 or 12 weeks.     Mice were sacrificed immediately, or six weeks following the last cigarette.     Left lung lobes were removed and flash frozen.     Total RNA was isolated from a small part of the frozen lung and was hybridized against universal mouse reference RNA to Agilent Oligo DNA microarrays (Agilent Technologies) containing 22,000 transcripts.     Microarrays were normalized using a global LOWESS approach and analyzed by MAANOVA 2.0 and SAM. Microarray results were validated by real time RT-PCR. Impact of alteration in expression of select genes was further validated by analysing their total protein levels in lung tissue homogenates.
 E-GEOD-49323 - Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition attenuates insterstitial injury in a murine model of chronic glomerulonephritis Evolution of glomerulonephritis (GN) to tubulointerstitial disease is a universal antecedent to the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD).  There is also evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition may attenuate the development of CKD in some forms of glomerulonephritis.      We tested the role of ACE inhibition in a model of GN in which complement-dependent tubulointerstitial disease develops.     GN was induced in C57BL/6 mice with intraperitoneal injections of horse spleen apoferritin (HSA) using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as an adjuvant.      Four groups of six animals were studied:  saline-injected control mice treated with captopril or water, and GN mice treated with captopril or water.     GN developed in all HSA-treated animals.      In those receiving captopril, however, proteinuria (albumin/creatinine ratio) was significantly reduced by captopril treatment.      Array screening was used to examined the expression of collagen-related genes and determine if these effects could be mediated by regulation of collagen genes.      Six genes were identified for further analysis by quantitative RT-PCR.  This model demonstrates that tubulointerstitial disease can be attenuated by ACE inhibition, with clinical, histologic, and gene expression measures.     All protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at SUNY Upstate Medical University.     We employed four groups of six mice each:  saline-injected control mice with and without captopril, and GN with and without captopril.      C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME).  Glomerulonephritis (GN) was induced by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 10 mg of apoferritin from horse spleen (HSA, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) five days per week, with i.p. injection of 100 micrograms lipopolysaccharide (LPS, from Salmonella minnesota; EMD Biosciences, La Jolla, CA), as adjuvant, three times per week.      Control animals received equal volumes of 0.15 M NaCl by i.p. injection.      Injections were begun when the mice were approximately eight weeks of age and were continued for six weeks.      Captopril, at 100 mg/kg/day was given in the drinking water.      After 9 weeks, the animals were euthanized and kidneys were removed for RNA purification and analysis.
 E-GEOD-47150 - Microarray profiling of primary neurons transduced with shRNA for multiple ASD-implicated genes Austism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous behavioral disease most commonly characterized by severe impairment of social engagement and the presence of repetitive activities.     The molecular etiology of ASD is still largely unknown despite a strong genetic component.      Part of the difficulty in turning genetics into disease mechanisms and potentially new therapeutics is the sheer number and diversity of the genes that have been associated with ASD and ASD symptoms.      The goal of this work is to use shRNA-generated models of genetic defects proposed as causative for ASD to identify the common pathways that might explain how they produce a common clinical outcome.      Transcript levels of Mecp2, Mef2a, Mef2d, Fmr1, Nlgn1, Nlgn3, Pten, and Shank3 were knocked-down in mouse primary neuron cultures using shRNA/lentivirus constructs.     Whole genome expression analysis was conducted for each of the knock-down cultures as well as a mock-transduced culture and a culture exposed to a lentivirus expressing luciferase.      Gene set enrichment and a causal reasoning engine were employed to indentify pathway level perturbations generated by the transcript knock-down.     Quantitation of the shRNA targets confirmed the successful knock-down at the transcript and protein levels of at least 75% for each of the genes.      After subtracting out potential artifacts caused by transfection and viral infection, gene set enrichment and causal reasoning engine analysis showed that a significant number of gene expression changes mapped to pathways associated with neurogenesis, long-term potentiation, and synaptic activity.      This work demonstrates that despite the complex genetic nature of ASD, there are common molecular mechanisms that connect many of the best established autism candidate genes.      By identifying the key regulatory checkpoints in the interlinking transcriptional networks underlying autism, we are better able to discover the ideal points of intervention that provide the broadest efficacy across the diverse population of autism patients.     n=4 per group.      Luciferase shRNA used as control group for shRNA to various gene targets.
 E-GEOD-31849 - Genome-wide activity-dependent MeCP2 phosphorylation regulates nervous system development and function [cultured cortical neurons] To examine potential differences in activity-dependent gene expression, we analyzed mRNA expression in cultured neurons isolated from Wild-type vs MeCP2 S421A mice at 0 (unstimulated), 1 or 6 hours after membrane depolarization by exposure to high extracellular KCl (55mM) All mice were male littermates from one of three litters.     We isolated RNA from dissociated cortical cultures (E16+7DIV) isolated from  Wild-Type or MeCP2 S421A knock-in mice littermates.     Cells were either left unstimulated or depolarized for 1 or 6 hours by addition of 55mM KCl to the media.      mRNA expression was analyzed using the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Expression Set 430 2.0 microarray platform.
 E-GEOD-45820 - Expression data from murine cardiac fibroblasts and endothelial cells following Transverse Aortic Constriction Accumulation of activated cardiac fibroblasts plays a key role in heart failure progression.     These cells deposit excessive extracellular matrix that leads to mechanical stiffness, myocyte uncoupling and ischemia.     To investigate whether two developmentally distinct cardiac fibroblast populations exhibit distinct expression profiles in response to cardiac injury, and therefore might necessitate distinct therapeutic targeting, we performed microarray analysis on FACS sorted cells.     Tie2cre lineage traced CFs, non Tie2cre lineage traced cardiac fibroblasts and endothelial cells were isolated from left ventricle of SHAM operated and banded hearts at the onset of fibrosis, one week after surgery.     We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in cardiac fibroblasts and endothelium following pressure overload.     Tie2cre lineage traced, non-tie2cre lineage traced fibroblasts and endothelial cells were sorted from left ventricle of 3 SHAM operated and 3 TAC operated adult male Black Swiss mice.     Tie2cre lineage traced, non-tie2cre lineage traced fibroblasts and endothelial cells were sorted from left ventricle of 3 SHAM operated and 3 Transaortic Constriction (TAC) operated adult male Black Swiss mice for RNA extraction and Affymetrix microarray analysis.     Hypertrophy in TAC animals, an lack of hypertrophy in SHAM operated animals, was evaluated by hemodynamic measurements before surgery and one week after surgery.     Cells were isolated one week after surgery.
 E-GEOD-27083 - Expression data from MMTV-PDK1 transgenic mice The role of PDK1 on mammary tumorigenesis and its interaction with PPARdelta, was assessed.     Transgenic mice were generated in which PDK1 was expressed in the mammary epithelium.     We used microarrays to analyse global gene expression changes in MMTV-PDK1 transgenic mice versus wild-type mice and determine any differential responses to GW501516 treatment.     RNA was isolated (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen) from mammary gland tissue from nulliparious transgenic and wild-type mice maintained on normal rodent chow or a diet supplemented with GW501516 for 1 week.
 E-MTAB-1774 - Transcription profiling by array of mouse primary Cyp27b1 knockout skin fibroblasts treated with vitamin D3 metabolites Comparison of the effects of 1a,25(OH)2D3, 25(OH)D3, and 24R,25(OH)2D3 on gene expression patterns
 E-GEOD-11139 - Elucidating a normal function of huntingtin by analysis of huntingtin-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts The polyglutamine expansion in huntingtin (Htt) protein is a cause of Huntington’s disease (HD).  Htt is an essential gene as  deletion of the mouse Htt gene homolog (Hdh) is embryonic lethal in mice.     Therefore, in addition to elucidating the mechanisms responsible for polyQ-mediated pathology, it is also important to understand the normal function of Htt protein for both basic biology and for HD. To systematically search for a mouse Htt function, we took advantage of the Hdh +/- and Hdh-floxed mice and generated four mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells lines which contain a single copy of the Hdh gene (Hdh-HET) and four MEF lines in which the Hdh gene was deleted (Hdh-KO).   The function of Htt in calcium (Ca2+) signaling was analyzed in Ca2+ imaging experiments with generated cell lines.       We found that the cytoplasmic Ca2+ spikes resulting from the activation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) and the ensuing mitochondrial Ca2+ signals were suppressed in the Hdh-KO cells when compared to Hdh-HET cells.      Furthermore,  in experiments with permeabilized cells we found that the InsP3-sensitivity of Ca2+ mobilization from endoplasmic reticulum was reduced in Hdh-KO cells.      These results indicated that Htt plays an important role in modulating InsP3R-mediated Ca2+ signaling.      To further evaluate function of Htt, we performed genome-wide transcription profiling of generated  Hdh-HET and Hdh-KO cells by microarray.      Our results revealed that 106 unique transcripts were downregulated by more than two-fold with p   0.05 and 173 unique transcripts were upregulated at least two-fold with p   0.05 in Hdh-KO cells when compared to Hdh-HET cells.      The microarray results were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR for a number of affected transcripts.      Several signaling pathways affected by Hdh gene deletion were identified from annotation of the microarray results.       The unbiased approach used in our study provides novel and unique information about the normal function of Htt in cells, which may contribute to our understanding and treatment of HD. Keywords: cell type comparison we generate four Hdh-HET MEF cell lines and four Hdh-KO MEF cell lines, and performed genome-wide transcription profiling of generated  Hdh-HET and Hdh-KO cells by microarray.
 E-GEOD-20097 - Genome-wide RNAi screen identifies miR-19 targets in Notch-induced acute T-cell leukaemia (T-ALL) MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as novel cancer genes.     In particular, the 17~92 cluster of miRNAs is highly expressed in haematopoietic cancers and promotes lymphomagenesis in vivo1,2. Clinical use of these findings hinges on isolating the oncogenic activity within the 17~92 cluster and defining its relevant target genes.     Here we show that miR-19 is sufficient to promote leukaemogenesis in Notch1 induced T-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) in vivo.     Consistent with the pathogenic importance of this interaction, we report a novel translocation targeting the 17~92 miRNA cluster coinciding with a second rearrangement that activates Notch1 in T-ALL. To identify the miR-19 targets responsible for its oncogenic action, we conducted a large-scale short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen for genes whose knockdown could phenocopy miR-19. Strikingly, the results of this screen were enriched for miR-19 target genes, and included Bim (Bcl2L11)1,3, AMP-activated kinase (Prkaa1), and the tumour suppressor phosphatases Pten and PP2A (Ppp2r5e). Hence, an unbiased, functional genomics approach reveals a coordinate clamp down on several regulators of PI3K-related survival signals by the leukaemogenic miR-19. Gene expression data revealing differences in gene expression between parental FL5-12 cells transduced with Vector and miR-19 expressing FL5-12 cells
 E-GEOD-6813 - Gene expression profiles of CD4+CD25+ Tregs from NOD and B6.H2g7 mice The NOD (nonobese diabetic) mouse strain develops a characteristic autoimmune syndrome that closely resembles human type I diabetes.      It has been suggested that NOD mice exhibit both numerical deficiency in CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Treg) and reduced suppressive activity.      We compared sorted CD4+CD25+ Tregs from the spleens of 6-7 week-old female NOD and nondiabetic B6.H2g7 mice.      Tregs were 93±2% and 95±1% Foxp3+ in NOD and B6.H2g7 cells, respectively, on post-sort reanalysis.      &quot;Conventional&quot; CD4+CD25- T cells (Tconv) are included as reference populations.      Surprisingly, Treg &quot;signature&quot; is similar between the two strains, with only a few probesets that subtly deviate.     Keywords: Cell population comparison from two mouse strains.     For each strain (NOD and B6.g7), we analyzed two populations: CD4+CD25+ Treg and CD4+CD25- Tconv cells, for a total of four distinct populations.      RNA from three mice were pooled for each replicate; there are three independent replicates for each population.      After RMA normalization, intensity values were averaged across the three replicates and analyzed.      We calculated the ratio of Treg/Tconv intensity values for each strain and compared the results.
 E-GEOD-79466 - Gene expression profiling of PBMC from coinfected or non-coinfected mice at d0, d3, d7, and d21 post YFV-17D challenge We tested the effects of co-infection on vaccine response to YFV-17D. Groups of mice were divided into either Mock infected or Co-infected groups.      Mock infected were housed in a biohazard facility and inoculated with PBS.  Co-infected were infected sequentially with murine gammaherpesvirus-68, murine cytomegalovirus, influenza WSN, and Heligmosimoides polygyrus.      Both mock and co-infected groups were challenged with Yellow Fever virus (YFV-17D).  Day 0 is prior to YFV.  Days 3, 7, and 21 were timepoints after YFV.
 E-GEOD-12367 - Transcription profiling of mouse Deaf-1-transduced mammary epithelial cells Microarray analysis was used to compare the gene expression profiles of Deaf-1-transduced mouse mammary epithelial cells (MECs) relative to Deaf-1-deficient MECs. Experiment Overall Design: To investigate potential target genes of Deaf-1, primary mammary epithelial cells (MECs) were isolated from a Deaf-1-null mouse and immortalised by transduction with a retrovirus encoding the human papilloma virus (HPV16) E6/E7 proteins.      Two clones were selected and transduced with either an empty retrovirus or one encoding Deaf-1. RNA was subsequently isolated from cells at 24 and 48 hours after transduction for Affymetrix analysis.      High levels of Deaf-1 expression were demonstrated in cells transduced with the Deaf-1 retrovirus relative to controls following a 48 hour selection in puromycin.      This time-point was therefore selected for further analysis.     Experiment Overall Design: To compare the gene expression profiles of Deaf-1-transduced MECs relative to Deaf-1-deficient MECs, Affymetrix analysis was performed using the GeneChip® Mouse Expression Set 430 2.0 array which comprises 39,000 transcripts on a single array.      Total RNA was harvested from two independent clones (C1 and E1) infected with either control or Deaf-1-expressing retrovirus making 4 samples in total.      Clones C1 and E1 were treated as biological replicates in the subsequent analysis.
 E-GEOD-29317 - Adult and neonatal astrocytes exhibit diverse gene expression profiles during exposure to beta amyloid ex vivo Research regarding the role of astrocytes as β-amyloid (Aβ) degrading cells has broadened our view about the mechanisms how these common glia cells function in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Based on previous studies adult mouse astrocytes are able to degrade Aβ deposits from AD mouse model and human brain tissue sections ex vivo, contrary to neonatal astrocytes.     In this study, we studied the possible altered gene expression profiles of adult and neonatal astrocytes cultured for 22 h on top of the Aβ burdened tg APdE9 or wild-type mouse brain sections using whole genome microarrays.     Quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed the significant up-regulation of HtrA serine peptidase 1 (Htra1), metallopeptidase 9 (Mmp9), phosphate regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X chromosome (Phex) and scavenger receptor class A, member 5 (Scara5) in adult astrocytes, whereas neonatal astrocytes up-regulated Mmp9 and down-regulated genes related to cholesterol transport and synthesis: apolipoprotein E (Apoe), 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (Dhcr24) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1 (Hmgcs1). These findings brought out novel genes which expression is altered during Aβ clearance in adult and neonatal astrocytes ex vivo.     Astrocyte cultures: For the adult astrocyte cultures, hippocampi and cortices were isolated from 6-8-week-old C57Bl/6j  wild-type and tg eGFP mice and the tissue was suspended in DMEM/F12 (3:1, Gibco BRL, NY, USA) containing 10 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco BRL) and 100 U / ml penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco BRL). The cells were treated with Percoll (Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, USA) and plated onto poly-L-lysine coated flasks in DMEM/F12 (3:1) containing 10 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 U / ml penicillin-streptomycin and G5 supplement (Gibco BRL). Before the experiments the glial cell cultures were shaken to remove microglia at 200 rpm for 2 h. For the neonatal astrocyte cultures, hippocampi and cortices were isolated from 2-day-old wild-type and eGFP mice according to the protocol described above, except that the culture medium was DMEM (+4500mg/l glucose, + L-glutamine, -pyruvate, Gibco BRL) without G5 supplement and the isolation method included no Percoll treatment.     Standard anti-GFAP (1:500; Dako Cytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) immunocytochemistry was used to determine the purity of astrocyte cultures.     The cells were  incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200 dilution; Vector Laboratories, CA) secondary antibody and Vectastain ABC Elite kit was used (Vector Laboratories) according to manufacturer’s protocol.      Hydroxen peroxide (H2O2) and nickel enhanced diaminobenzidine (Ni-DAB) was added to detect the immunoreactivity.     Three fields per well and at least three wells per cell type were analyzed for the percentage of Ni-DAB stained cells of all cellular profiles in the field.     Adult and neonatal astrocyte cultures both contained on average 99.6 % ± 0.6 % anti-GFAP immunoreactive astrocytes.     Anti-Iba (2 µg/ml; Wako, Germany) and anti-CD11b (1:500 dilution; Serotec, UK) antibodies were used to detect possible microglial cells.     The cultures contained less than 0.4 % of microglial cells in all experiments.     Ex vivo treatments: tg APdE9 / wild-type mouse brain section incubated with neonatal (age 3 d) or adult (age 6-8 wks) mouse eGFP expressing astrocytes (4 x 105 cells / well), n=6. The mouse brain sections used were prepared from tg APdE9 mouse line (created by co-injection of chimeric mouse/human APPSwe and PS1-dE9 vectors, both controlled by their own mouse prion protein promoter element [APdE9 mice (Jankowsky et al. 2004) provided by Prof.     Heikki Tanila] and their wild type C57Bl/6j littermates.     Before the mRNA isolation process, the samples were pooled (n=3). The purity of the samples was checked with FACS (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson, USA) using the analyzing program CellQuestTM version 3.3 (Becton Dickinson, USA). After 22 h incubation the culture medium was removed from the wells and the brain sections with cultured eGFP astrocytes were incubated with 1 x trypsin-EDTA (500 µl /well) for up to 15 min at 37° C.  Partial detachment (at this point, the astrocytes should not lose the grip completely) of the astrocytes from the underlying brain section was monitored with a standard light microscope.     After the incubation the brain sections with cultured astrocytes were carefully removed into small petri dishes filled with FBS-containing culture medium to inactivate the trypsin.      Subsequently, the brain sections were immediately examined with fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX-71, Japan). The eGFP astrocytes were separated from the underlying brain section using a special suction hose, which was a modified version from suction hoses typically used for the microinjection techniques.     In the other end of the tube there is a pipet tip as a mouthpiece, in the middle of the tube a 0.22 µm filter and in the other end a stretched glass capillary (prepared with a Bunsen burner). The green fluorescent eGFP astrocytes were picked up gently from the underlying brain section (without breaking the brain tissue) using wavelength 468 nm of the fluorescence microscope and simultaneous light microscopy.     Data normalization and analysis: The raw data was preprocessed with the robust multichip algorithm (Irizarry et al. 2003), normalized per chip to the median.     12 samples were grouped into 4 sample types: adult wt, adult tg, neonatal wt, neonatal tg. The change in the astrocyte gene expression was identified according to the sections the astrocytes were incubated (WT or TG). The differentially expressed probe sets were further processed using statistical analysis with Welch unpaired t-test assuming unequal variances (p 0.05; fold change   2.0 or    0.5). Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple testing was used to control the number of false-positives results.
 E-GEOD-21576 - Expression profiles of laser dissected colon tumor samples of wild-type mice and vil-Cre-Bcl9-/-/Bcl9l-/- mice To investigate the impact of ablating Bcl9/Bcl9l on tumorigenesis, 6-8- week-old mice were exposed first to a single dose dimethylhydrazine (DMH, 44 mg/kg body weight), which is metabolized in the liver to carcinogenic azoxymethane (AOM), followed by 7 days oral administration of 2 % dextrane sulfate sodium (DSS) in the drinking water.     This regimen results in the emergence of dysplastic adenomas, which progress to differentiated adenocarcinomas that are morphologically similar to human colorectal adenocarcinomas and typically harbor β-catenin stabilizing mutations of GSK3ß phosphorylation sites.     Accordingly, these tumors present hallmarks of active Wnt signaling such as accumulation of nuclear β-catenin and expression of Wnt target genes.     Total RNA of laser dissected samples from five different tumors each of two wild-type mice and three vil-Cre-Bcl9-/-/Bcl9l-/- mice was collected and resulting amplified cDNA hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays.     Samples are labeled as follows: Genotype TumorID MouseID UniqueID.
 E-GEOD-23101 - Comparative Effects of Statins on Murine Cardiac Gene Expression Profiles in Normal Mice Recent clinical data suggest that the efficacy of statin treatment in patients with heart failure varies depending on the drugs administered.     Therefore, the present study was undertaken to compare murine cardiac gene expression following treatment with four different statins.     Statins directly regulated cardiac gene expression in a drug-specific manner in mice.     The influence of each statin on the cardiac mRNA expression of various genes, including several genes that might be involved in the development of cardiac disease, was not a general effect of this class of drugs.     Male C57BL/6J mice (n = 20) were treated with or without a statin (pitavastatin calcium, pravastatin sodium, rosuvastatin calcium, or atorvastatin calcium hydrate) (n = 4 in each group) for four weeks.     Total RNA was isolated from the left ventricle of each animal.     The fragmented and labeled amplified cDNA was hybridized to a GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (Affymetrix). Data and statistical analysis were performed with GeneSpring GX version 11.0 software (Agilent Technologies).
 E-GEOD-15718 - Gene expression in dendritic cells stimulated with LPS in conditions allowing or inhibiting NFAT activation Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is one of the molecules produced by mouse dendritic cells (DCs) after stimulation by Toll like receptor (TLR) agonists.     By analogy with the events following T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement leading to IL-2 production we have observed that DC stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces Src-family kinase and phospholipase C (PLC)γ2 activation, influx of extracellular Ca2+ and calcineurin-dependent nuclear NFAT translocation.     We have also observed that the initiation of this pathway is independent of TLR4 engagement, and dependent exclusively on CD14. To determine the role of NFAT in LPS activated dendritic cells we have performed microarray analysis in conditions allowing or inhibiting NFAT activation.     We show here that LPS-induced NFAT activation via CD14 is necessary to cause death of terminally differentiated DCs, an event that is essential for maintaining self-tolerance and preventing autoimmunity.     Consequently, blocking this pathway in vivo causes prolonged DC survival and an increase in T cell priming capability.     Gene expression analyses were performed using Affymetrix GeneChips in the following groups of murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells: 1) CD14-deficient BMDCs stimulated with LPS; 2) wtBMDCs stimulated with LPS in presence of EGTA; 3) wtBMDCs stimulated with LPS. This experimental setting allowed us to select for effects due to Ca2+ fluxes and exclude the effects due to other causes, particularly the block of TRIF recruitment in CD14-deficient cells and the EGTA effects unrelated to Ca2+ chelation.
 E-GEOD-39621 - Expression data from brain, liver and spleen of Npc1-/- mice Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) disease is a rare, genetic, lysosomal disorder with progressive neurodegeneration.     Poor understanding of the pathophysiology and lack of blood-based diagnostic markers are major hurdles in the treatment and management of NPC and several additional neurological, lysosomal disorders.     To identify disease severity correlates, we undertook whole genome expression profiling of sentinel organs, brain, liver, and spleen of Balb/c Npc1-/- mice (Npc1nih)relative to Npc1+/- at an asymptomatic stage, as well as early- and late-symptomatic stages.      Unexpectedly, we found prominent up regulation of innate immunity genes with age-dependent change in their expression, in all three organs.     We shortlisted a set of 12 secretory genes whose expression steadily increased with age in both brain and liver, as potential plasma correlates for the neurological disease.     Ten were innate immune genes with eight ascribed to lysosomes.     Several are known to be elevated in diseased organs of murine models of other lysosomal diseases including Gaucher’s disease, Sandhoff disease and MPSIIIB. We validated the top candidate lysozyme, in the plasma of Npc1-/- as well as Balb/c Npc1nmf164 mice (bearing a point mutation closer to human disease mutants) and show its reduction in response to an emerging therapeutic.     We further established elevation of innate immunity in Npc1-/- mice through multiple functional assays including inhibition of bacterial infection as well as cellular analysis and immunohistochemistry.     We used microarrays on the diseased organs, brain, liver and spleen of the Npc1-/- mice  to unserstand the molecular changes occur during the progression of NPC diseases.     From the data, we have identified 12 potential genes which can be potentially developed as blood-based biomarker.     We have also discovered up regulation of innate iimunity genes in all three organs of Npc1-/- mice and functionally validated them in liver and spleen.     Brain from 11 female Npc1−/− and 16 control female mice (Npc1+/+ and Npc1+/−) from 6 age groups (20-25, 37-40, 54-55, 59-62, 67-71 and 81-84 days) were surgically harvested.     Liver and spleen from 6 Npc1-/- and 6 Npc1+/-  female mice from three age group ( 20-25, 54-55 and 67-71 days) were surgically harvested.     Organs were kept in RNA later and stored at -20 °C until used.     RNA was isolated and Affymetrix mouse 430 2.0 array hybridizations were performed by ‘UCLA Clinical Microarray Core’, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA. Subsequent raw data were analyzed using DNA-Chip Analyzer (D-Chip) with the .CEL files obtained from AGCC. Data from Npc1-/- mice from all age groups were compared to control mice (Npc1+/- and/or Npc1-/- mice) from all age groups separately for brain, liver and spleen.     'Matrix Table1' corrsponds for brain, 'Matrix Table2' corresponds for liver and 'Matrix Table3' corresponds for spleen.     Thresholds for selecting significant genes were set at a relative difference ³1.5-fold, absolute difference ³100 signal intensity units and p 0.05. Genes that met all three criteria simultaneously were considered as significant change.
 E-GEOD-2202 - Transcription profiling of mouse ES cells knocked out for SOCS3 Series contains four arrays - two wildtype, two null.      The experiment studied the effect of knocking out SOCS3 in mouse ES cells.
 E-MTAB-1970 - Transcription profiling by array of mouse placentas from two transgenic STOX1-overexpressing strains (which show preeclampsia-like symptoms) and non-transgnic controls with and without aspirin, a drug which can revert such symptoms STOX1 overexpressing placentas generate preeclampsia-like symptoms in pregnant mice.     These symptoms are reverted by aspirin.     The experiment aims at analyzing placental expression in Transgenic/non transgenic with and withou aspirin, in the placentas at 16,5 days post-coïtum.     There are two strains of transgenic mice that express the transgene at different levels: STOX42 about 15 fold that of STOX13. STOX13 expressed the human STOX1 roughly at the level of the mouse endogeneous Stox1 in the placenta.
 E-GEOD-19757 - Expression Data from Bone Marrow Progenitor-Derived Adipocytes, White Adipocytes and Brown Adipocytes. We have identified a population of adipocytes in fat tissue that arise from bone marrow-derived progenitor cells.     We used microarrays to compare the global gene expression patterns of the bone marrow progenitor-derived adipocytes as well as conventional white and brown adipocytes to evaluate the relationship between these adipocyte subpopulations.     Gonadal fat tissue (for white adipocytes) and intrascapular fat tissue (for brown adipocytes) was digested with collagenase and adipocytes were recovered by centrifugation/flotation.      Bone marrow derived adipocytes were isolated from the adipocyte fraction of gonadal fat tissue from mice receiving bone marrow tranplants from donors expressing either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or beta-galactosidase (LacZ) by flow cytometry.
 E-MEXP-1371 - Transcription profiling of mouse T-cell thymocytes and bone marrow-derived macrophages dervied from Upf2fl/fl;LysMCre and Upf2fl/fl;LckCre mice to test the importance of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay on global transcription Knockdown experiments in transformed human cells, suggested that nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) components had extensive effects on the regulation of a significant fraction of the transcriptome   In order to test the importance of NMD on global transcription we subjected BMDMs and T-cell thymocytes derived from Upf2fl/fl;LysMCre and Upf2fl/fl;LckCre mice, respectively, to microarray-based gene expression profiling.     Both these cell types display strong, if not complete, reduction of NMD as assayed by transfection with reporter constructs or sequencing of Tcrb transcripts.     Upf2¯/¯ BMDMs displayed significant changes in the expression of 182 genes (234 probe sets) of which 179 were upregulated.
 E-GEOD-9675 - Transcription profiling of mouse embryos exposed to diabetes reveals maternal diabetes alters transcriptional programs in the developing embryo Diabetic embryopathy can affect any developing organ system, although cardiovascular malformations, neural tube defects and caudal dysgenesis syndrome are the most prominent congenital malformations.     We hypothesize that the metabolic imbalance occurring in diabetic pregnancy de-regulates tissue specific gene expression programs in the developing embryo.     In order to identify genes whose expression is affected by maternal diabetes, we analyzed gene expression profiles of diabetes-exposed mouse embryos by using Affymetrix microarrays.     We identified 129 genes with altered expression levels; 21 genes had increased and 108 genes had decreased expression levels in diabetes-exposed embryos relative to controls.     A substantial fraction of these genes (35) are essential for normal embryonic development as shown by functional studies in mouse models.     The largest fraction of diabetes-affected genes was in transcription factor and DNA-binding/chromatin remodeling functional categories (19%), which directly affect transcription.     These findings suggest that transcriptional regulation in the developing embryos is perturbed by maternal diabetes and that transcriptional regulation plays a major role in the responses of embryos to intrauterine exposure to diabetic conditions.     Interestingly, we found the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 α (Hif1α) deregulated in the embryos exposed to the conditions of maternal diabetes.     Since hypoxic stress is associated with the complications of diabetic pregnancy, we performed a post-hoc analysis of our microarray data with a specific focus on known HIF1 target genes.     Of 39 genes detected in our microarrays, the expression changes of 22 genes (20 were increased and two genes were decreased in diabetes-exposed embryos) were statistically significant.     These results indicate that HIF1-regulated pathways are affected in diabetes-exposed embryos.     These results strongly suggest that de-regulation of hypoxia/HIF1 activated pathways could be the one of the key molecular events associated with the exposure to the teratogenic intrauterine environment of a diabetic mother.     Experiment Overall Design: Total RNA was isolated from whole embryos at embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5). Five diabetes-exposed embryos (2 of 5 embryos had neural tube defects; NTD) were compared to  two control embryos.     Diabetes was induced in female FVB mice (aged 7-9 weeks) by streptozotocin Embryos were isolated only from dams that were classified as diabetic with the blood glucose levels   250 mg/dl from the mating day until the day of embryo harvest.     Five ug  of total RNA was reverse-transcribed, and biotin-labeled cRNA probe generated using the Affymetrix labeling kit and protocol per manufacturers instructions.     Probes were then hybridized to the Affymetrix 430A 2.0 genome chip with 14,338 genes.     Following washing and staining, the chips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 scanner in Genetic Microarray Core Facility at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.     Images were analyzed using Affymetrix GCOS imaging software.     Quality metric parameters including noise level, background, and the efficiency of reverse transcription were ascertained for all hybridizations.     The expression levels and the “call” of “Present”, “Marginal”, “Absent” for each probe set were determined by the comparison of the signal intensity of matched and mismatched oligonucleotide probes for the gene sequence.
 E-MEXP-748 - Transcription profiling of four mouse tissues following acute caloric restriction Multi-tissue transcriptional response following acute caloric restriction in mice.
 E-GEOD-40856 - Non-tumor/tumor intestinal tissue of control or intestine-specific HAI-1 deficient Apc(Min/+) mice To analyse roles of HAI-1/Spint1 in intestinal tumorigenesis, we examined the effect of intestine-specific deletion of Spint1 gene on Apc(Min/+) mice.     The loss of Hai-1/Spint1 significantly accelerated tumor formation in ApcMin/+ mice and shortened their survival periods.     Mouse small intestine tumor tissue or background mucosa lacking macroscopically visible tumors were proceeded to RNA extraction and hybridization on microarrays (Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array). Non-tumor or tumor intestinal mucosa tissues of Apc (Min/+)/Spint1 (flox/flox) mice and non-tumor or tumor intestinal mucosa tissues of  Apc (Min/+)/Spint1 (flox/flox)/Vil-Cre mice were analysed.     The experiment was repeated respectively.
 E-MEXP-2952 - Transcription profiling by array of mouse epidermis and pancreas following MycERTAM activation at 4 time points The transcription factor Myc is a critical regulator of diverse cellular processes, including both replication and apoptosis.     However, differences in Myc-regulated gene expression responsible for such opposing outcomes in vivo remain obscure.     To address this we have examined time-dependent changes in global gene expression in vivo in two distinct transgenic mouse models in which conditional Myc activation promotes distinct outcomes - tissue expansion in skin suprabasal keratinocytes (SBK) or involution in pancreatic islet beta cells.     We utilised the MycERTAM transgenic mouse model, allowing activation of a chimeric Myc protein via daily treatment with 4 hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT). We compared the change in expression following MycERTAM activation at 4 time points (4hrs, 8hrs, 16hrs and 32hrs following 4OHT treatment) for the two tissues to identify genes whose expression profiles differ between the two.
 E-GEOD-31598 - Expression data from directly induced neural stem cells Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells give rise to neural stem cells, which are applicable for therapeutic transplantation in treatment of neural diseases.     However, generation of neural stem cells from iPS cells requires a careful selection of safe iPS clones.     We sought to determine whether direct induction of neural stem cells from partially reprogrammed somatic cells is able to generate safer cells rapidly.     We have successfully established direct induction system from fibroblast to neural stem cells.     To characterize these directly induced neural stem cells, Gene expression profiles were compared with iPS cell or ES cell-derived neurosphere.     We used affymetrix microarrays to compare the global gene expression of neurospheres prepared several method.     RNA extracted from neurospheres was hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays.     The mouse strain used in this study except ES/iPS cells was C57BL/6.
 E-GEOD-17794 - Expression data from B6C3F1 mice treated with 2-butoxyethanol Mice were dosed  with 2-BE (900mg/kg) or vehicle by oral gavage and sacrificied either after 4 hours of a single dose or after 7 days of daily dosing.     Mice were euthanased by cervical dislocation under ketamine / acepromazine (100 mg/kg / 5 mg/kg, I.P) anesthesia.     The bone marrow from the right humerus, a portion of the left lateral liver lobe and half a cross-section of the spleen were harvested and the RNA was isolated from these tissues using standard Qiagen reagents.     Standard Affymetrix protocols were used for GeneChip probe preparations.     44 arrays.
 E-GEOD-17509 - Transcription profiling of mouse spleen from animals exposed to Ebola virus reveals reduced levels of protein tyrosine phosphatase CD45 protect mice from the lethal effects of Ebola virus infection To gain insight into the changes in gene expression pattern upon Ebola infection, CD45+/+ (100% protein level) and CD45+/- (62% protein level) mice were challenged with mouse adapted Ebola virus.     At time-points day 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13, spleen tissue was harvested and splenocytes isolated.     Total RNA was isolated for mRNA expression analysis.     The mouse genome 430 2.0 array (Affymetrix, Inc.), which consists of over 39,000 genes in a single array, was used.      Based on gene expression patterns, the variable genes were grouped into sixteen clusters.     Each cluster contained genes associated with cellular immune processes, signaling, cell-cycle, complement coagulation cascade, biosynthesis/metabolism, ubiquitous genes involved in several cascades, and genes of unknown function.      Interestingly, gene expression in clusters 2 and 3 were significantly downregulated by day 1 following EBOV challenge in CD45100% mice.      In contrast, at day 1 following EBOV infection, the CD45 62% mice maintained gene expression patterns similar to day 0.  The differences in gene expression patterns between the CD45 100% and CD45 62% splenocytes were less apparent at day 3 following infection and by days 5 and 7 they became very similar.      At day 9, when wild-type mice had succumbed to the disease, the pattern in CD45 62% mice remained similar to the day 7 patterns of CD45 100% and CD45 62% mice.      The pattern at days 11 and 13 in the CD45 62% mice had returned to that of day 0 CD45 100% or CD45 62% mice.      These results suggested that in CD45 100% mice, subversion of the cell transcriptional machinery during the early stages of EBOV infection (day 1) might represent a major factor leading to death of the mice.      In CD45 62% mice, early control of gene regulation likely provided the appropriate antiviral responses leading to regulated inflammation, immune co-stimulation, and survival.       Experiment Overall Design: RNA expression in CD45 100% and 62% mice were compared at each time point: days 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7, using an empirical Bayes procedure.     From 3 to 8 biological replicates were in each group.     Samples for days 9, 11, and 13 (4 biological replicates each) were also available for only CD45 62%. Median expression values for highly variable genes within each group were clustered using agglomerative nesting over all available time points.
 E-GEOD-65352 - Gene expression of livers from Lpcat3fl/fl and Lpcat3fl/fl Albumin-Cre mice on chow diet The total abundance of phosphatidylcholine (PC) is known to influence lipoprotein production.      However, the role of specific phospholipid species in lipid transport has been difficult to assess due to an inability to selectively manipulate membrane composition in vivo.      Here we show that the LXR-regulated phospholipid remodeling enzyme lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (Lpcat3) is a critical determinant of membrane phospholipid composition and lipoprotein production.      Mice lacking Lpcat3 in the liver show defects in lipoprotein production.     The objective of generating this dataset was to analyze the effects of Lpcat3 loss of function on baseline gene expression in mouse liver.     This dataset compares gene expression in Lpcat3fl/fl and Lpcat3fl/fl Albumin-Cre liver samples from 12-week old male mice that were subjected to 6 hr fasting.     Each sample contains tissues from 5 mice.
 E-GEOD-36618 - Mechanisms of terminal erythroid differentiation defect in EKLF-deficient mice EKLF is a Krüppel-like transcription factor identified as a transcriptional activator and chromatin modifier in erythroid cells.     EKLF-deficient (Eklf -/-) mice die at day 14.5 of gestation from severe anemia.     In this study, we demonstrate that early progenitor cells fail to undergo terminal erythroid differention in Eklf -/- embryos.     To discover potential EKLF target genes responsible for the failure of erythropoiesis, transcriptional profiling was performed with RNA from wild type and Eklf -/- early erythroid progenitor cells.     These analyses identified significant perturbation of a network of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, with the critical regulator of the cell cycle, E2f2, at a hub.     E2f2 mRNA and protein levels were markedly decreased in Eklf -/- early erythroid progenitor cells, which showed a delay in the G1-to-S-phase transition.     Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated EKLF occupancy at the proximal E2f2 promoter in vivo.     Consistent with the role of EKLF as a chromatin modifier, EKLF binding-sites in the E2f2 promoter were located in a region of EKLF-dependent DNase I sensitivity in early erythroid progenitor cells.     We propose a model in which EKLF-dependent activation and modification of the E2f2 locus is required for cell cycle progression preceding terminal erythroid differentiation.     RNA was isolated from flow-sorted early erythroid progenitors in 13.5 day old fetal livers from EKLF knock out mice (n=3 fetal livers) and wild-type control mice (n=3 fetal livers) for gene expression analysis
 E-TABM-683 - Transcription profiling of mouse normal mammary gland epithelial populations: basal/myoepithelial, luminal estrogen receptor negative (ER-) and luminal estrogen receptor positive (ER+) cells The goal of the experiment was to carry out a transcriptome analysis of the three main epithelial cell populations of the mouse mammary gland, the basal/myoepithelial, luminal estrogen receptor negative (ER-) and luminal estrogen receptor positive (ER+) cells, to identify cell-type specific differences in gene expression.     Three replicates arrays were carried out for each of the three populations (a total of nine arrays). Each replicate was a genuine biological replicate from RNA harvested from completely independent cell preparations.     Each sample was isolated from preparations of mammary epithelium derived fourth mammary fat pads of 8   10 week old virgin female FVB mice.     Each preparation was from a pool of 10   20 animals (20   40 fat pads).
 E-GEOD-64004 - Expression data from ileum of mice suffered from subchronic and mild social defeat stress This study aimed to investigate the effects of depression on transcriptome in ileum using a subchronic and mild social defeat stress (sCSDS) model.     In addition to exhibiting social deficit and hyperphagia-like behavior, the sCSDS mice keep much more water in their body than control mice.     In order to investigate the effect of social defeat stress on not only central nervous system but also function of gastrointestinal tract, the gene expression in ileum of stressed mice was compared with control mice.     We used microarrays to detail the gene expression after 10 days of social defeat stress and identified distinct classes of down-regulated genes during this process.     The duration of physical contacts was set at 5 min after the first attack bite at Day 1, and then was reduced 0.5 min per day from Day 2 to Day 10.
 E-GEOD-53388 - Immunotherapy Targets in Tumors Recent work has shown that cytotoxic T cells play a central role in immune-mediated control of cancers1-3, and monoclonal antibodies that target inhibitory receptors on T cells can induce significant clinical benefit in patients despite advanced disease4-6. However, many of the regulatory pathways that result in loss of T cell function within immunosuppressive tumors remain unknown.     Here we show that such regulatory mechanisms can be systematically discovered in vivo in the tumor microenvironment.     We devised a pool shRNA screening approach aimed at identifying genes that block the function of tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells.     We postulated that shRNAs targeting key inhibitors would enable robust T cell infiltration and proliferation in tumors, despite multiple inhibitory signals.     Candidate shRNAs were discovered by transfer of shRNA-transduced T cells into tumor-bearing mice, followed by deep sequencing to quantify the representation of all hairpins in tumors and lymphoid organs.     A subset of shRNAs induced T cell accumulation in tumors but not the spleen, demonstrating feasibility of discovering shRNAs with differential action across tissues.     One of the targets was Ppp2r2d, a regulatory subunit of the family of PP2A phosphatases7. Control shRNA-transduced T cells underwent apoptosis upon recognition of melanoma cells, while Ppp2r2d shRNA-transduced T cells accumulated in tumors due to enhanced proliferation and reduced apoptosis.     Ppp2r2d shRNAexpressing T cells also significantly delayed tumor growth.     This in vivo approach has wide applications to dissect complex immune functions in relevant tissue microenvironments.     OT-I derived T cells were transduced with shRNA's and adoptively transferred to B16 tumor bearing mice.     Following incubation the T cells were purified from either tumors or spleens.     The shRNA's targeted either a control gene (LacZ) or one of 5 selected genes found to regulate the presence of T cells in tumors vs in spleen
 E-MEXP-1383 - Transcription profiling of transgenic mice overexpressing human alpha-synuclein under the PDGF beta promoter to wildtype littermates at 3 months and 9 months of age. Microarray comparison of  transgenic mice overexpressing human alpha-synuclein under the PDGF beta promoter to wildtype littermates at 3 months and 9 months of age.      RNA was extracted from substantia nigral cells that were isolated by laser capture microdissection.
 E-MEXP-2995 - Transcription profiling by array of mouse M1 cells expressing Batf targeting siRNA or control siRNA and treated with leukemia inhibitory factor to identify putative downstream targets of Batf In order to identify putative downstream targets of Batf in M1 cells, a microarray analysis was performed.     Briefly, M1/Neg-RNAi (expressing control siRNA with no mammalian target) and M1/Batf-RNAi cells (expressing Batf targeting siRNA) were seeded in M1 growth medium at a density of 3 X 105/ml in 100mm culture dishes.     Six plates were plated for each cell type.     Within each group, three were labeled as + LIF and treated with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (5 ng/ml) for 6 hours the following day.     After 6 hours, the cells were harvested from all plates individually and RNA prepared.     5 µg of total RNA from the three individual samples representing each subgroup (M1/Neg-RNAi + LIF, - LIF; M1/Batf-RNAi + LIF, - LIF) were combined into one pool of RNA. EJT001 represents sample "M1/Neg-RNAi, no LIF)";  EJT002 represents sample "M1/Neg-RNAi, with LIF)"; EJT003 represents sample "M1/Batf-RNAi, no LIF)"; EJT004 represents sample "M1/Batf-RNAi, with LIF)". The four pools of RNA were shipped to Genome Explorations, Inc. for analysis using Affymetrix GeneChip technology.     The differentially regulated genes were identified both within each group (+ LIF compared to - LIF) and between 2 goups (M1/Neg-RNAi and M1/Batf-RNAi).
 E-GEOD-8949 - Transcription profiling of mouse aorta during activation of or interference with PPAR gamma signaling. Ligand-mediated activation of the nuclear hormone receptor PPAR gamma lowers blood pressure and improves glucose tolerance in humans.      Two naturally occurring mutations (P467L, V290M) in the ligand binding domain of PPAR gamma have been described in humans that lead to severe insulin resistance and hypertension.      Experimental evidence suggests that these mutant versions of PPAR gamma act in a dominant negative fashion.      To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying PPAR gamma action in the vasculature, we determined the gene expression patterns in mouse aorta in response to activation or interference with the PPAR gamma signaling pathway.     Experiment Overall Design: To assess the response to PPAR gamma interference, we used adult mice containing a dominant negative form of PPAR gamma.     These mice have a targeted P465L mutation, which is equivalent to the P467L mutant, described in human patients.     Wild-type littermates were used as the genetic control.     The PPAR gamma signaling pathway was activated by administration of rosiglitazone for either 2 or 14 days to adult mice (C57BL/6J strain) at a dose of 3 or 10 mg/kg/day via the food.     Control mice were fed standard mouse chow.     For the microarray hybridizations, 2-3 biological replicates from each experimental group were used.      Biological replicates were RNA pooled from 8 different mouse aortas.     All the microarray procedures were conducted at the University of Iowa DNA Core facility using standard Affymetrix protocols.      In brief, approximately 3 ug of total RNA was used as input to a one-step amplification procedure to generate biotin-labeled RNA fragments for hybridization to the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array.
 E-GEOD-1835 - Transcription profiling of mouse retina response to myocilin. Russell-7U24NS043571-02 Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease in which vision is lost as a result of the apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells.     When the trabecular meshwork cells,  that regulate aqueous humor outflow, are stressed as they are in some forms of glaucoma, they considerably up-regulated secretion of a protein called myocilin into the aqueous.     The function of this protein is unclear; but since some aqueous humor flows to the posterior of the eye, the effects of myocilin will also be felt by the retinal cells.     We have a transgenic mouse that secretes large amounts of myocilin into aqueous humor.     In these mice, there is a deposition of myocilin on membranes of certain cells suggesting myocilin might have some signaling functions.     This signaling function could explain why stresses that increase intraocular pressures can increase the likelihood for glaucoma, cause the myocilin to be secreted at very high levels by the trabecular meshwork.     Myocilin may be important in treating glaucoma.     This experiment will determine if myocilin is altering gene expression in the retina.     The results should show variations in expression levels and will give us some indication of the pathways that are important to preserve retinal ganglion cells after a diagnosis of glaucoma.     Our hypothesis is that myocilin is acting like a signaling protein in the eye.     It acts not only in the anterior segment but also in retina as a result of the flow of some aqueous to the back of the eye.     This signaling function is protective to certain ocular cells.     This function of myocilin may influence cells in the retina and may counter the apoptotic signals in the retinal ganglion cells that occur during glaucoma.     Retinas from transgenic mice and from mice of the same strain that do not have the transgene will be dissected.     The mice will be three weeks of age.     Because of the small size of the retina, samples will be pooled to obtain the RNA necessary to run the microarray.     Three control and three transgenic samples will be run and compared with each other.     We have data indicating that myocilin is at high levels in the aqueous humor of the transgenic animals.
 E-GEOD-37274 - Identification of stem cell populations in sweat glands and ducts: roles in homeostasis and wound repair Sweat glands are abundant glands of our body and essential for thermoregulation.     Like mammary glands, they originate from epidermal progenitors.     However, they display few signs of cellular turnover, and whether they have stem cells and tissue regenerative capacity remain largely unexplored.     Here we address these issues.     Using lineage-tracing, we identify multipotent progenitors in sweat duct that transition to unipotency after developing the sweat gland.     In characterizing four adult stem cell populations of glandular skin, we show that they display distinct regenerative capabilities and remain unipotent when healing epidermal, myoepithelial-specific and luminal-specific injuries.     We devise purification schemes, isolate and transcriptionally profile progenitors.     Exploiting molecular differences between sweat and mammary glands, we show that only some progenitors regain multipotency to produce de novo ductal and glandular structures, but that these can retain their identity even within certain foreign microenvironments.     Our findings provide new concepts about glandular stem cells and sweat gland biology.     10 samples from mouse paw pads were analyzed
 E-GEOD-54557 - Transcription profiling of liver from farnesoid X receptor knockout mice Expression profiling of whole body (WB) FXR knockout (KO) mice (FXR WB KO), liver-specific FXR KO mice (AFXR Cre+) and enterocyte specific FXR KO mice (VFXR Cre+) on a C57BL/6J genetic background Whole body (WB) FXR knockout (KO) mice (FXR WB KO), liver-specific FXR KO mice (AFXR Cre+) and enterocyte specific FXR KO mice (VFXR Cre+) on a C57BL/6J genetic background were bred and maintained in the laboratory animal research facility at the University of Kansas Medical Center in rooms under a 12-hour light-dark cycle.      All experiments used 10-16 week-old male mice.      FXR was activated by treatment with the FXR synthetic agonist, GW4064, at 150 mg/kg. GW4064 or vehicle was administered by oral gavage at 6 p.m., followed by a second administration at 8 a.m. the next morning.      Two hours later, the liver was harvested.
 E-GEOD-22890 - IFN-γ Upregulates Survivin and Ifi202 Expression to Induce Survival and Proliferation of Tumor-Specific T Cells Transcriptional profiling of mouse tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) comparing activation-induced gene expression profiles induced by tumor-specific antigen (Ag) and CD3 mAb. CTLs were stimulated with either Ag or CD3 mAb for 3 and 24 h, respectively.     The stimulated CTLs were compared to un-stimulated CTLs. The objective was to identify differential gene expression profiles induced by the two activation (Ag vs CD3 mAb) conditions.     Two-condition experiments, un-stimulated vs stimulated CTLs. Biological replicates: 3 replicates for each comparison.     Unstimulated CTLs were compared to stimulated CTLs (Ag and CD3 mAb, respectively).
 E-GEOD-27379 - CD8+ T cell mediated lung inflammation Role for naturally occurring CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (nTregs) in counterbalancing this process.     Using a transgenic murine model for autoimmune-mediated lung disease, we demonstrated that, despite pulmonary inflammation, lung-specific CD8+ T cells can reside quiescently in close proximity to self-antigen.     Whereas self-reactive CD8+ T cells in the inflamed lung and lung-draining lymph nodes down-regulated the expression of effector molecules, those located in the spleen appeared to be partly antigen-experienced and displayed a memory-like phenotype.     Since ex vivo-reisolated self-reactive CD8+ T cells were very well capable to respond to the antigen in vitro, we investigated a possible contribution of nTregs to the immune control over autoaggressive CD8+ T cells in the lung.     We isolated antigen-specifc CD8+ T-cells from lungs and bronchial lymphnodes derived from chronic diseased mice (SPC-HAxCL4), healthy control mice (CL4) and acute influenza infected control mice (CL4+IAV) and perormed mRNA expression profiling of isolated CD8+ T cells.     Each group represents a pool of at least n=4 animals.     CD8+ T cell type comparison; lung disease state analysis
 E-GEOD-5671 - Transcription profiling of mouse embryonic stem cell line mESC D3 reveals cardiac differentiation of embryonic stem cells recapitulates embryonic cardiac development. Mouse embryonic stem cells can differentiate in vitro into spontaneously contracting cardiomyocytes.     The main objective of this study was to investigate cardiogenesis in cultures of differentiating embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and to determine how closely it mimics in vivo cardiac development.     We identified and isolated a population of cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) through the use of a reporter DNA construct that allowed the expression of a selectable marker under the control of the Nkx2.5 enhancer.     We proceeded to characterize these CPCs by examining their capacity to differentiate into cardiomyocytes and to proliferate.     We then performed a large-scale temporal microarray expression analysis in order to identify genes that are uniquely upregulated or downregulated in the CPC population.     We determined that the transcriptional profile of the mESC derived CPCs was consistent with pathways known to be active during embryonic cardiac development.     We conclude that in vitro differentiation of mESCs recapitulates the early steps of mouse cardiac development.      Experiment Overall Design: Cell culture and cell differentiation Experiment Overall Design: Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) were maintained undifferentiated by culturing on a feeder layer of mitomycin C pretreated primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PMEFs, Specialty Media, cat.# PMEF-H) at 37oC, 90% humidity and 5% CO2. The cell line used was the mESC D3 (passage #12-18). The basic culture medium was comprised of DMEM (Invitrogen, cat.# 11965-092), heat inactivated (56oC for 30 minutes) fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, cat#. S11550, 15%), Glutamax (Invitrogen, cat.# 35050-065, 1%), non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen, cat.# 11140-050, 1%), sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen, cat.# 11360-070, 1%), ?-mercaptoethanol (Sigma, cat.# M7522, 0.1mM), gentamicin (Cambrex, cat.# 17-518, 25?g/ml) and ESGRO leukemia inhibitory factor (Chemicon, cat.# ESG1106, 1000units/ml). Prior to initiation of differentiation The PMEF feeder layer was subtracted and the mESCs were maintained on a 0.01% gelatin pretreated plate for 24-48 hours.     Differentiation through embryoid body (EB) formation was initiated by dissociating the mESCs using trypsin (Invitrogen, cat#. 25300-054, 0.05%) and resuspending them in basic culture medium (without the leukemia inhibitory factor) at a final concentration of 5x104 cells/ml. The hanging droplet (HD) technique was used for EB formation.     HDs were plated on the lid of H2O containing tissue culture dishes at a volume of 20?L/droplet (approximately 1000 cells/ droplet). Two days post initiation of differentiation the EBs were transferred in suspension on poly-HEMA (Sigma, cat#. P3932) treated tissue culture dishes.     The plates were pretreated with poly-HEMA in order to avoid any cell attachment on the plastic.     Basic culture medium was supplemented with ascorbic acid(Takahashi et al., 2003) (Sigma, cat#. A4403, 0.1mg/ml) and it was exchanged with fresh medium every 2 days during differentiation.      Experiment Overall Design: Transfection of mouse embryonic stem cells Experiment Overall Design:  The mouse Nkx2.5 enhancer fragment #5(Lien et al., 1999) and the hsp68 minimal promoter was excised from the provided vector (XhoI/ NcoI) and inserted in front of the EGFP gene in the Bluescript vector.     A vector containing the hygromycin resistance gene (hygromycin phosphotransferase) under the control of the mouse polymerase II promoter was also used in order to select for the transfected mESCs. Prior to transfection the two vectors were linearized.     Undifferentiated mESCs were grown to confluency on a layer of primary embryonic fibroblasts and dissociated with trypsin.     The cells were combined with the linearized DNA and electroporated (Biorad Gene Pulser Xcell, 240V/ 500?F). The cells were then replated on a fresh layer of PMEFs. Hygromycin B (Invitrogen, cat.# 10687-010, 50?g/ml) was used for 7 days after transfection for selection.     Resistant colonies were picked and grown on layers of PMEFs in the presence of antibiotic.     Once sufficient cells were present the clones were differentiated in order to check for the correct expression of the GFP in the cardiac areas (spontaneously contracting) of the differentiating cultures.     Successful clones were further amplified and used for characterization of the GFP expressing cardiac progenitor cells.     Experiment Overall Design:  In order to select mESC derived cardiomyocytes for the microarray analysis experiment, a stable transgenic clone of mESCs was made that allowed the expression of the neomycin resistance gene under the control of the alpha myosin heavy chain promoter (U71441) as described by Klug et al., (Klug et al., 1996). The transgenic clone was prepared as described above.       Experiment Overall Design: FACS Analysis Experiment Overall Design:  For determination of the CPC yield in the differentiating cells, EBs were harvested at the indicated timepoints (between days 6 and 10 of differentiation). Each sample contained approximately 100 hanging droplets on day 0 of differentiation.     The EBs were washed in PBS and resuspended in 0.05% trypsin at 4oC (1/2 hour) and 37oC (10 minutes). The percentage of GFP+ cells was determined in a BD FACS Calibur (Cell Quest Pro software). Age matched EBs from untransfected mESCs were used as negative controls.     Cells from the same samples were also counted.     Experiment Overall Design: FACS sorting Experiment Overall Design:  The BD Biosciences FACSAria Cell sorting system was used to sort the GFP+ and GFP- cells between days 5 and 10 of differentiation.     EBs were harvested and dissociated as described above.     The cells were suspended in sorting medium (96% DMEM without phenol red, 1% fetal bovine serum, 1% Glutamax, 1% non essential amino acids, 1% sodium pyruvate, 25?g/ml gentamicin) and kept at 4oC. The cells were sorted into a fetal bovine serum rich medium (20%) in order to increase their survival.     For further culture the cells were resuspended in mESC culture medium at a concentration of 5x105 cells/ml and cultured in suspension for 48 hours.     The cells were then transferred on tissue culture plates for another 48 hours.     For RNA isolation the cells were spun down and washed in PBS before the RNA isolation procedure.     Experiment Overall Design:  To assay their proliferation capacity, GFP+ CPCs were FACS sorted on day 5 of differentiation.     Cells were reaggregated in suspension (5x105 cells/ ml) in the presence of mouse recombinant Igf1 (Chemicon, Cat.# GF121, 100ng/ml) for 14 days.     Cell aggregates were fixed and stained for the colocalization of the antigens: Nkx2-5 and Ki67 or Pcna.     The same ICC reagents were used as described above.      Experiment Overall Design: GeneChip microarray hybridization Experiment Overall Design:  Total RNA for the microarray expression analysis was isolated from FACS sorted cells (GFP+ and GFP-) on days 5, 6, 7, and 8 of differentiation as described above.     Two separate differentiation batches were prepared for the sake of data reproducibility.     Total RNA was also isolated from terminally differentiated mESC derived genetically selected cardiomyocytes 3 weeks post initiation of differentiation.     The GeneChip® two cycle target labeling kit (Affymetrix, cat.# 900494) was used to convert 100ng of total RNA to biotinylated labeled cRNA. This was then hybridized to the Affymetrix murine MOE430 2.0 genome GeneChip® array (Affymetrix, cat.# 900496). Fluorescence was detected using the Affymetrix GS3000 GeneArray scanner and image analysis for each chip was done through the GeneChip® operating system software from Affymetrix (GCOS1.3) using the standard default settings.     Experiment Overall Design: Microarray data analysis Experiment Overall Design: To estimate the gene expression signals, data analysis was conducted on the chips’ CEL file probe signal values at the Affymetrix probe pair (perfect match (PM) probe and mismatch (MM) probe) level, using the statistical technique RMA (Robust Multiarray Analysis) (Irizarry et al., 2003) with the bioconductor package Affy.     The data normalization procedure utilized the quantile normalization method (Bolstad et al., 2003) to reduce the obscuring variation between microarrays, which might be introduced during the processes of sample preparation, manufacture, fluorescence labeling, hybridization and/or scanning.     Experiment Overall Design: The Spotfire DecisionSite software package was used for the identification of uniquely upregulated or downregulated (at least 1.5 times increase or decrease in the expression value) probe sets in the CPC population when compared to the rest of the cells in the differentiating EBs. Probe sets that were considered unique for the CPC population were found to be commonly upregulated or downregulated during all four days of analysis.     Probe sets that exhibited an increasing or decreasing pattern of expression with at least 1.5 times increase or decrease in the expression values of day 5 CPCs and day 8 CPCs were also reported.     Probe sets of the CPC population that exhibited upregulation or downregulation by at least 1.5 times when compared to the mESC derived cardiomyocytes were also reported.     The final analysis included probe sets that exhibited a different temporal pattern of expression in the CPC population when compared to the rest of the cells along the four days of differentiation.     Specifically in order to identify these probe sets gene expression curve over time was modeled flexibly
 E-MTAB-4453 - Transcription profiling by array of three T-cell populations isolated from the ears of mice treated with Imiquimod The imiquimod model is used to induce the skin production of IL-22 and to characterize the cells that produce IL-22 in the skin after inflammatory stimulus.     This experiment is performed on skin of C57Bl/6 mice treated with imiquimod to induce psoriasis-like lesions.     After 5 days of imiquimod treatment, we analysed the heamatopoietic cells that infiltrate the skin and we compared the gene signature of three T cell populations: CD4+ T cells, CD4-CD8-(DN) T cells and gd T cells
 E-GEOD-8468 - Micro-RNAs levels in wildtype vs. Ahr-null adult mouse liver constitutively and in response to doxin treatment. Dioxin-like chemicals are well-known for their ability to upregulate expression of numerous genes via the AH receptor (AHR).  However, recent transcriptomic analyses in several laboratories indicate that dioxin-like chemicals or AHR genotype itself also can downregulate levels of mRNAs encoded by numerous genes.      The mechanism responsible for such downregulation is unknown.      We hypothesized that microRNAs (miRNAs), which have emerged as powerful negative regulators of mRNA levels in several systems, might be responsible for mRNA downregulation in dioxin/AHR pathways.     We conducted a thorough investigation to address the following questions: (1) does AHR genotype itself affect constitutive expression of microRNAs?  (2) does TCDD affect microRNA levels and, if so, is this response dependent on the AHR?  (3) does TCDD affect microRNA levels differently in animals that are sensitive to dioxin toxicity versus those that are dioxin-resistant? We used the Exiqon miRNA array platform as well as quantitative RT-PCR to measure miRNA levels in wildtype vs. Ahr-null mice.     Treatment with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in vivo caused few changes in miRNA levels in mouse livers and those changes that were statistically significant were of modest magnitude.       AHR genotype had little effect on hepatic miRNA levels, either in constitutive expression or in response to TCDD – only a few miRNAs differed in expression between Ahr-null mice compared to mice with wildtype AHR. It is unlikely that mRNA downregulation by dioxins is mediated by miRNAs, nor are miRNAs likely to play a significant role in dioxin toxicity in adult mouse liver.     Manuscript Submitted: Moffat ID, Boutros PC, Celius T, Pohjanvirta R & Okey AB. Micro-RNAs in rodent liver are refractory to dioxin treatment.     Toxicological Sciences May, 2007. Keywords: miRNA expression, gene knockout, response to xenobiotics, genetic modification This was a two-factor, two-level design, the factors being genotype Ahr+/+ (WT) or Ahr-/- (KO) and treatment TCDD-treated (T) or vehicle control (C).   Each total-RNA sample was separately labeled either with a Hy3- or a Hy5-fluorophore (Exiqon).  Hy3- and Hy5-labeled samples were co-hybridized to an array.     Dye-reversal was performed to eliminate dye bias.     We tested 3 TCDD-treated and 3 control mice in the Ahr-/- groups and 4 TCDD-treated and 4 control mice in the Ahr+/+ groups.     Technical replication of 1 TCDD-treated and 1 control mice in the Ahr-/- groups was performed.      A loop design was used.
 E-GEOD-18293 - Transcription profiling of mouse pneumonic plague model after infection with wild-type Yersinia pestis CO92 and its Braun lipoprotein mutant Swiss-Webster female mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) 5-6 weeks of age were infected intranasally with 5 LD50 of either WT or Δlpp mutant of Y. pestis CO92. Uninfected mice were used as controls.     At either 12 or 48 h post infection (p.i.), 3 mice per group were euthanized and the lungs, livers, and spleens were harvested and homogenized in 1 ml of RNALater (Ambion/Applied Biosystems, Austin, TX) using 50-ml tissue homogenizers (Kendell, Mansfield, MA). RNA was isolated from the tissue homogenates and purified using RNAqueous (Ambion). After an overnight precipitation, the RNA was resuspended in 20 ul of diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays, performed by the Molecular Genomics Core at UTMB Galveston, Texas, per manufacture protocols.     The arrays had 45,000 probe sets representing more than 39,000 transcripts derived from ~34,000 well-substantiated mouse genes.     The experiments were performed in triplicate (biological replicates), generating a total of 45 arrays.     Experiment Overall Design: At either 12 or 48 h post infection (p.i.), 3 mice per group were euthanized and the lungs, livers, and spleens were harvested and homogenized in 1 ml of RNALater (Ambion/Applied Biosystems, Austin, TX) using 50-ml tissue homogenizers (Kendell, Mansfield, MA). RNA was isolated from the tissue homogenates and purified using RNAqueous (Ambion). After an overnight precipitation, the RNA was resuspended in 20 ul of diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays, performed by the Molecular Genomics Core at UTMB Galveston, Texas, per manufacture protocols.
 E-GEOD-53231 - Expression data from 18h-fasted WT versus KLF15-null mice: heart We used microarray analysis to identify differences in gene expression levels in heart following an 18h (overnight) fast in WT control and KLF15-null mice Heart tissue was isolated from 3-4 month old, 18h-fasted WT and KLF15-null male mice for RNA extraction and hydridization on Affymetrix microarrays
 E-GEOD-21711 - Effect of cholera toxin or forskolin on mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells from C57BL/6 mice were treated with 1 ug/ml cholera toxin, 10 uM forskolin or control medium for 2 h. drug treatment groups
 E-GEOD-11990 - Gene expression profiling of mouse p53-deficient epidermal carcinoma defines molecular determinants of human cancer malignancy (training dataset) The epidermal specific ablation of Trp53 gene leads to the spontaneous development of aggressive tumors in mice through a process that is accelerated by the simultaneous ablation of Rb gene.     Since alterations of p53-dependent pathway are common hallmarks of aggressive, poor prognostic human cancers, these mouse models can recapitulate the molecular features of some of these human malignancies.     To evaluate this possibility, gene expression microarray analysis was performed in mouse samples.     The mouse tumors display increased expression of cell cycle and chromosomal instability associated genes.     Remarkably, they are also enriched in human embryonic stem cell gene signatures, a characteristic feature of human aggressive tumors.     Using cross-species comparison and meta-analytical approaches, we also observed that spontaneous mouse tumors display robust similarities with gene expression profiles of human tumors bearing mutated TP53, or displaying poor prognostic outcome, from multiple body tissues.     We have obtained a 20-gene signature whose genes are overexpressed in mouse tumors and can identify human tumors with poor outcome from breast cancer, astrocytoma and multiple myeloma.     This signature was consistently overexpressed in additional mouse tumors using microarray analysis.     Two of the genes of this signature, AURKA and UBE2C, were validated in human breast and cervical cancer as potential biomarkers of malignancy.     Our analyses demonstrate that these mouse models are promising preclinical tools aimed to search for malignancy biomarkers and to test targeted therapies of prospective use in human aggressive tumors and/or with p53 mutation or inactivation.     Control skin was compared with skin tumors arising in k14Cre;p53loxP/loxP and k14Cre;p53loxP/loxP;pRbloxP/loxP animals, giving a mouse p53-tumor signature
 E-GEOD-38138 - Hepatic gene expression in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice fed a phloridzin diet Phloridzin is a dihydrochalcone typically contained in apples.     A diet containing 0.5 % phloridzin significantly improves hyperglycemia but not hypoinsulinemia and tissue lipid peroxidation in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice after 14 days.     The phloridzin diet has no effect on the alteration of hepatic gene expression in STZ-induced diabetic mice.     A quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed a reversal of the STZ induction of the sodium/glucose cotransporter gene Sglt1 and the drug-metabolizing enzyme genes Cyp2b10 and Ephx1 in the small intestine of mice fed a 0.5% phloridzin diet.     These mice also showed a reversal of the STZ-mediated renal induction of the glucose-regulated facilitated glucose transporter gene Glut2. Dietary phloridzin improved the abnormal elevations in blood glucose level and the overexpression of Sglt1, Cyp2b10 and Ephx1 in the small intestine of STZ-induced diabetic mice.     Six-week-old male mice were divided into 4 groups of 6 mice each, housed in groups of 3 per cage.     After 1 week mice were intraperitoneally injected with STZ.  Mice (n=6) in the untreated control group did not receive any treatment.     After 1 week, 18 mice showing non-fasting blood glucose levels of 330-590 mg/dL were divided into 3 groups: one group was fed with AIN93G only (control group), the others with an AIN93G diet containing 0.1% or 0.5% phloridzin (Funakoshi, Tokyo, Japan) for 2 weeks.

 E-GEOD-23782 - Adult epidermal Notch activity induces dermal accumulation of stromal cells K14NICDER transgenic and wildtype littermate mice were treated with 4OHT for 14 days to activate the transgene Epidermis and dermis preparations from Transgenic and Wild type mice plus whole skin We sought to compare gene expression patterns in K14NICDER transgenic epidermis and dermis to wild type controls
 E-GEOD-12503 - The protein disulfide isomerase AGR2 is essential for the production of intestinal mucus Protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) aid protein folding and assembly by catalyzing formation and shuffling of cysteine disulfide bonds in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Many members of the PDI family are expressed in mammals but the roles of specific PDIs in vivo are poorly understood.     A recent homology-based search for additional PDI family members identified anterior gradient homolog 2 (AGR2), a protein originally presumed to be secreted by intestinal epithelial cells, but the function of AGR2 has been obscure.     Here we show that AGR2 is expressed in the ER of secretory cells and is essential for in vivo production of intestinal mucin, a large cysteine-rich glycoprotein that forms the protective mucus gel lining the intestine.     A cysteine residue within the AGR2 thioredoxin-like domain forms mixed disulfide bonds with MUC2, consistent with a direct role for AGR2 in mucin processing.     Despite a complete absence of intestinal mucin, mice lacking AGR2 appeared healthy but were highly susceptible to dextran sodium sulfate-induced experimental colitis, indicating a critical role for AGR2 in protection from environmental insults.     We conclude that AGR2 is a unique member of the PDI family that has a specialized and non-redundant role in intestinal mucus production.      Keywords: small intestine and colon gene expression profiles for Agr2-/- and littermate control mice DNA miocroarrays were used to analyze small intenstine and colon mRNA expression of AGR2 KO and littermate control mice.     The experiment incorporated a 1 color design and used Agilent arrays that contained roughly 44,00 60mer probes that provide complete coverage of the mouse genome.     12 arrays were hybridized and represent 8 small intestine samples ( 4 each KO and WT) and 4 colon samples (2 each KO and WT)
 E-GEOD-6485 - Transcription profiling of mouse olfactory epithelium frpm Harlequin mutants compared to littermate controls Microarray analysis of gene expression in the olfactory epithelium of Harlequin mouse as a model of oxidative-stress induced neurodegeneration of olfactory sensory neurons Experiment Overall Design: Olfactory epithelium from Harlequin mutant mice and littermate control mice was microdissected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.     We compared levels of gene expression in 6-month old mice to begin to identify mechanisms of oxidative-stress induced neurodegeneration and to correlate the cellular changes that we observed in the olfactory epithelium by using histology and immunohistochemistry with gene expression changes.
 E-GEOD-6686 - Transcription profiling of mouse skeletal muscle after gene transfer by electroporation vs. Controls Abstract; Background: Gene transfer by electroporation (electro gene transfer) to muscle results in high level long term transgenic expression, showing great promise for treatment of e.g. protein deficiency syndromes.     However little is known about the effects of electro gene transfer on muscle fibres.     We have therefore investigated transcriptional changes through gene expression profile analyses, as well as morphological changes evaluated by histological analysis.     Electro gene transfer was obtained using a combination of a short high voltage pulse (HV, 1000 V/cm, 100 @s) followed by a long low voltage pulse (LV, 100 V/cm, 400 ms); a pulse combination optimised for efficient and safe gene transfer.     Muscles were transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and excised at 4 hours, 48 hours or 3 weeks after treatment.     Results: Differentially expressed genes were investigated by microarray analysis, and descriptive statistics were performed to evaluate the effects of 1) electroporation, 2) DNA injection, and 3) time after treatment.     The biological significance of the results was assessed by gene annotation and supervised cluster analysis.     Generally, electroporation caused down-regulation of structural proteins e.g. sarcospan and catalytic en-zymes such as phosphoenolpuryvate carboxykinase.     Injection of DNA induced down-regulation of intracellular transport proteins e.g. sentrin.     The effects on muscle fibres were transient as the expression profiles 3 weeks after treatment were closely related with the control muscles.     Most interestingly, no changes in the expression of proteins involved in inflammatory responses or muscle regeneration was detected, indicating limited muscle damage and regeneration.     Histological analysis revealed structural changes with loss of cell integrity and striation pattern in some fibres after DNA+HV+LV treatment, while electroporation alone caused minor loss of striation pattern but preservation of cell integrity.     Conclusion: The small and transient changes found in the gene expression profiles are of great importance, as this demonstrates that electro gene transfer is safe with minor effects on the muscle host cells.     These findings are essential for introducing the electro gene transfer to muscle for clinical use.     Indeed the HV+LV pulse combination used have been optimised to ensure highly efficient and safe electro gene transfer.     Experiment Overall Design: The mice did recieve to their tibialis cranialis muscle either No tretment/control (CTRL), Electroporation only (EP), Plasmid injection only (DNA) or Plasmid DNA and in vivo Electro gene transfer (EP+DNA). Experiment Overall Design: Four hrs, 48 hrs and 3 weeks after treatment the mice were euthanized and the expression profile of the treated muscles were analysed.

 E-GEOD-6255 - Transcription profiling of human ermal lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) with those isolated from tumours of murine T241/VEGF-C/GFP metastatic fibrosarcoma reveals lymphatic endothelium of metastatic tumours has a distinct transcription profile. Invasion of lymphatic vessels is a key step in the metastasis of primary tumour cells to draining lymph nodes.     Recent evidence indicates that such metastasis can be facilitated by tumour lymphangiogenesis, although it remains unclear whether this is a consequence of increased lymphatic vessel numbers or alteration in the properties of the vessels themselves.     Here we have addressed this important question by comparing the RNA profile of normal dermal lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) with those isolated from tumours of murine T-241/VEGF-C metastatic fibrosarcoma.     Our findings reveal significant changes in the expression of some 792 genes in tumour lymphatics (≥ 2 fold up/downregulation, p ≤ 0.05), involving particularly transcripts associated with junctional adhesion, immunomodulation, extracellular matrix and vessel growth/patterning, several of which we have confirmed by RT-PCR and/or immunohistochemistry.     Interestingly, this altered phenotype could not be attributed solely to VEGF-C induced lymphoproliferation, as no similar change in gene expression was reported when human LEC were cultured with VEGF-C in vitro.     Moreover, we show that a key protein upregulated in the mouse model, namely the tight junction protein Endothelial Cell Specific Adhesion Molecule (ESAM), is similarly upregulated in tumour lymphatic vessels from 2/2 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and 4/4 patients with aggressive bladder carcinoma.     These findings demonstrate a previously unrecognized influence of tumour environment on lymphatic gene expression and identify candidate tumour specific vessel markers that may prove valuable for either prognosis or therapy.     Experiment Overall Design: Here we have investigated the invasion of lymphatic vessels as a key step in the metastasis of primary tumour cells to draining lymph nodes by comparing the gene expression profile of normal dermal lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) with those isolated from tumours of murine  T241/VEGF-C/GFP metastatic fibrosarcoma.     Three biological replicates were analyzed from each group.
 E-GEOD-36932 - Effect of squalene on liver transcriptome of mice lacking apolipoprotein E The hypothesis that the squalene of olive oil might influence hepatic gene expression in an apoE and sex-dependent ways was tested in mice.     Gene expression was analyzed using DNA microarrays in male apoE-deficient mice that received 1 g/kg/day of squalene for 10 weeks.     As initial screening of potential candidate genes involved in a differential response, only genes with remarkably modified expression (signal log2 ratio   1.5 or   -1.5) were further considered
 E-GEOD-23161 - Beta cell overexpression of HSD11B1 in high fat fed mice To model the potential diabetogenic effects of higher level of HSD11B1 in b-cells of the pancreas in vivo, we created a transgenic model overexpressing HSD11B1 under the mouse insulin I promoter (MIP-HSD1) in diabetes-prone C57Bl/KsJ mice.     KsJ wild type and MIP-HSD1 heterozygous mice have been high fat fed for 12 weeks.     Pancreata have been perfused with collagenase and islets isolated by hand picking.     Isolated islets (around 500) coming from at least 3 mice (around 200/mice) have been directly lysed in Trizol.     Total RNA have been extracted by Trizol plus RNA Purification Kit (invitrogen). Four biological replicates per group: Wild type KsJ mice on High Fat diet (KsJ1, KsJ2, KsJ3, KsJ4) and MIP-HSD1 transgenic mice on High Fat diet (MIP1, MIP2, MIP3, MIP4) were used to prepare RNA for microarray analysis.
 E-GEOD-18752 - Transcription profiling of mouse natural helper cell Innate immune responses are important in combating various microbes during the early phases of infection.     Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that, unlike T and B lymphocytes, do not express antigen receptors but rapidly exhibit cytotoxic activities against virus infected cells and produce various cytokines1,2. We report here a new type of innate lymphocyte present in a novel lymphoid structure associated with adipose tissues in the peritoneal cavity.     These cells do not express lineage (Lin) markers but express c-Kit, Sca-1, IL-7R and IL-33R. Similar lymphoid clusters were found in both human and mouse mesentery and we term this tissue “FALC” for fat-associated lymphoid cluster.     FALC Lin-c-Kit+Sca-1+ cells are distinct from lymphoid progenitors3 and lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells4. These cells proliferate in response to IL-2 and produce large amounts of Th2 cytokines such as IL-5, IL-6 and IL-13. IL-5 and IL-6 regulate B cell antibody production and self-renewal of B1 cells5-7. Indeed, FALC Lin-c-Kit+Sca-1+ cells support the self-renewal of B1 cells and enhance IgA production.     IL-5 and IL-13 mediate allergic inflammation and protection against helminth infection8,9. Upon helminth infection and in response to IL-33, FALC Lin-c-Kit+Sca-1+ cells produce large amounts of IL-13, which leads to goblet cell hyperplasia, a critical step for helminth expulsion.     In mice devoid of FALC Lin-c-Kit+Sca-1+ cells such goblet cell hyperplasia was not induced.     Thus, FALC Lin-c-Kit+Sca-1+ cells are Th2-type innate lymphocytes and we propose that these cells be called “natural helper cells”. Experiment Overall Design: Natural helper cells (Lin- c-kit+ Sca-1+) were isolated from mesentery of C57BL/6 for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.     For the control of this experiment, we use double negative cells (DN2) from thymus of C57BL/6 or lymphoid tissue inducer cells (LTi). Thymic DN2 cells were prepared from adult thymocytes.     Thymocytes were stained with magnetic beads conjugated with anti-CD4 and anti-CD8α mAbs and CD4-CD8- double negative (DN) cells were negatively sorted by AutoMACS. DN cells were further stained with anti-CD25 and anti-CD44 mAbs and CD25+CD44+ cells were sorted as DN2 cells on a FACSAria.Thy-1+CD4- LTi cells were prepared from fetal liver cells as described previously.     c-Kit+α4β7+IL-7Rα+ fetal liver cells from day 13 embryos were cultured on TSt4 cells for 17 days.
 E-GEOD-61554 - Treatment of C3H/HeJ grafted mice with baricitinib [topical] The C3H/HeJ grafted model of alopecia areata was used to determine the efficacy of systemic baricitinib at preventing alopecia or treating established disease.     The efficacy of topical baricitinib at treating established alopecia in the C3H/HeJ grafted model was also assessed.     Microarrays were performed on skin RNA at week 0 and week 12 after starting treatment in all models.     Baricitinib was administered in topical form after disease establishement.     Skin samples were taken at the start of treatment and after 12 weeks.
 E-GEOD-68745 - Expression data from wildtype and Tfr1 heart KO mice We deleted Tfr1 in the heart to determine the role of Tfr1 in iron uptake in normal cardiac funciton  We used microarrays to identify global gene changes associated with deletion of Tfr1 in skeletal muscle We isolated RNA from WT and Tfr1 KO hearts at both postnatal day 5 and postnatal day 10.RNA was labaled and hibridized to Affymetrics microarrays.
 E-GEOD-52797 - Expression data of Myh6-MeCP2 transgenic mice Hearts of Myh6-MeCP2 transgenic mice and wildtype littermates were rapidly dissected and flash frozen.     We used Affymetrix microarrays to assess gene expression changes induced by overexpression of MeCP2 under the control of a cardiomycyte specific promoter.     Hearts were dissected 2-3 weeks after birth from transgenic Myh6-MeCP2 mice and littermates to study gene expression alterations.
 E-GEOD-12693 - Transcription profiling of mouse liver from animals exposed to social stress Social stress is well known to be involved in the occurrence and exacerbation of mental illness, and also various life-style related diseases such as hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, cardiovascular diseases and cancer.     However, there is little information on tissue-specific gene expression in response to social stress, which reflects our daily life.     Liver is one of the most important organs, owing to its biological functions such as energy metabolic homeostasis, metabolization and detoxification of endo- and exogenous substances.     In order to elucidate the mechanism underlying response to social stress in the liver, we investigated hepatic gene expression in mice exposed to isolation stress using DNA microarray.     Male BALB/c mice (4 weeks old) were housed 5 per cage for 10 days acclimatization.     Then mice were exposed to isolation stress for 30 days.     After stress treatment, the mouse liver RNA was subjected to DNA microarray analysis.     Taking the false discovery rate into account, isolation stress altered expression of 420 genes.     Moreover, Gene Ontology analysis of these differentially expressed genes indicated that isolation stress remarkably down-regulated lipid metabolism-related pathway through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- (PPAR), while lipid biosynthesis pathway regulated by sterol regulatory element binding factor-1 (SREBF-1), Golgi vesicle transport and secretory pathway-related genes were significantly up-regulated.     These results suggested that isolation for 30 days, mild and consecutive social stress, not only regulate the systems for lipid metabolism but also cause the endoplasmic reticulum stress in mouse liver.     Experiment Overall Design: Male BALB/c mice (4 weeks old, Japan SLC, Shizuoka, Japan) weighing 14-18 g were housed 5 per cage.     After acclimatization for 10 days, the mice were exposed to isolation (1 mouse per cage). All cages were placed in a foam plastic box in order to avoid social contact.     To enhance the feeling of isolation, the bed volume in each cage for the isolated mice was reduced to one-tenth of that in the control group.     The weight of bedding chips was about 2 g. All mice were housed in an air-conditioned room ( room temperature: 23 ± 1°C, humidity: 55 ± 5 %) under 12 h dark/12 h light cycles, with free access to tap water and MF diet (Oriental Yeast Co., Tokyo, Japan).
 E-GEOD-20575 - Transcription profiling by array of mouse embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells Pluripotent cells can be derived from somatic cells by either overexpression of defined transcription factors (resulting in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)) or by nuclear transfer or cloning (resulting in NT-ESCs). To determine whether cloning further reprograms iPSCs, we used iPSCs as donor cells in nuclear transfer experiments.     An iPSC clone derived from tail-tip fibroblasts using adenoviral vectors was used as donor cell in nuclear transfer experiments.     RNA was isolated from both parental iPSC clone and derivative NT-ESCs lines and analyzed.
 E-GEOD-27848 - Dietary heme stimulates epithelial cell turnover by downregulating feedback inhibitors of proliferation in murine colon (part 2) The risk for colon cancer is associated with nutrition, especially high fat and low calcium diets high in red meat.     Red meat contains the iron porphyrin pigment heme, which induces cytotoxicity of the colon contents and epithelial hyperproliferation.     Using a mouse model, we showed that heme caused damage to the colonic surface epithelium and induced compensatory hyperproliferation.     Expression levels of heme- and stress-related genes show that heme affects surface cells and not directly crypt cells.     Therefore, injured surface cells should signal to crypt TA cells to induce compensatory hyperproliferation.     Surface-specific downregulated inhibitors of proliferation were Wnt inhibitory factor 1, Indian Hedgehog, Bone morphogenic protein 2 and possibly Interleukin-15.  Heme also upregulated Amphiregulin, Epiregulin and Cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA in the surface cells, however, their protein/metabolite levels were not increased as heme induced surface-specific translation repression by increasing 4E-BP1. Therefore, we conclude that heme induced colonic hyperproliferation and hyperplasia by repressing feedback inhibition of proliferation.     C57BL/6 mice received a Westernized high fat and low calcium diet with or without heme (the polyporphyrin pigment of red meat). Mice received control or heme diet for 14 days.     After 14 days, mice were sacrificed and colons were taken out.     RNA was isolated from colon scrapings and subjected to gene expression profiling (n=7 control mice and n=9 heme-fed mice).
 E-GEOD-18281 - Spatial mapping of thymic stromal microenvironments reveals unique features influencing T lymphoid differentiation Interaction of hematopoietic progenitors with the thymic stromal microenvironment induces them to proliferate, adopt the T cell fate, and asymmetrically diverge into multiple T lineages.     Progenitors at various developmental stages are stratified among different regions of the thymus, implying that the corresponding microenvironments differ from one another, and provide unique sets of signals to progenitors migrating between them.     The nature of these differences remains undefined.     Here we use novel physical and computational approaches to characterize these stromal subregions, distinguishing gene expression in microdissected tissues from that of their lymphoid constituents.     Using this approach, we comprehensively map gene expression in functionally distinct stromal microenvironments, and identify clusters of genes that define each region.     Quite unexpectedly, we find that the central cortex lacks distinctive features of its own, and instead appears to function by sequestering unique microenvironments found at the cortical extremities, and modulating the relative proximity of progenitors moving between them.     4 to 6 weeks old male C57bl6/J were used for microdissection of 3 thymic cortical subregions and thymic medulla or for sorting cortical and medullary thymocytes.      These samples were used for subsequent RNA purification, labeling and hybridization to Affymetrix arrays
 E-GEOD-49128 - Otitis Media Impact on Middle Ear Objective: Otitis media is known to alter expression of cytokine and other genes in the mouse middle ear and inner ear.     However, whole mouse genome studies of gene expression in otitis media have not previously been undertaken.     Ninety-nine percent of mouse genes are shared in the human, so these studies are relevant to the human condition.     Methods: To assess inflammation-driven processes in the mouse ear, gene chip analyses were conducted on mice treated with trans-tympanic heat-killed Hemophilus influenza using untreated mice as controls.     Middle and inner ear tissues were separately harvested at 6 hours, RNA extracted, and samples for each treatment processed on the Affymetrix 430 2.0 Gene Chip for expression of its 34,000 genes.     Results:  Statistical analysis of gene expression compared to control mice showed significant alteration of gene expression in 2,355 genes, 11% of the genes tested and 8% of the mouse genome.        Significant middle and inner ear upregulation (fold change  1.5, p 0.05) was seen in 1,081 and 599 genes respectively.      Significant middle and inner ear downregulation (fold change  0.67, p 0.05) was seen in 978 and 287 genes respectively.     While otitis media is widely believed to be an exclusively middle ear process with little impact on the inner ear, the inner ear changes noted in this study were numerous and discrete from the middle ear responses.     This suggests that the inner ear does indeed respond to otitis media and that its response is a distinctive process.      Numerous new genes, previously not studied, are found to be affected by inflammation in the ear.     Conclusion: Whole genome analysis via gene chip allows simultaneous examination of expression of hundreds of gene families influenced by inflammation in the middle ear.      Discovery of new gene families affected by inflammation may lead to new approaches to the study and treatment of otitis media.     There are 8 control samples and 9 samples trans-tympanically injected with H flu 10e9 for 6 hours.      Each sample is from a single animal.
 E-GEOD-11804 - Transcription profiling ofmouse skeletal muscle - pharmacological regulation Exercise activates serine/threonine kinase AMPK and transcriptional factor PPARdelta that re-model metabolism and endurance capacity of skeletal muscle.      Whether and how synthetic activation of these molecules regulated muscle gene signature is unknown.     We have conducted skeletal muscle microarrays from mice treated with AMPK agoinst (AICAR), PPARdelta agonist (GW1516) or the combination of the two drugs to investigate the individual and interactive effects of the two on muscle genes.     Experiment Overall Design: C57Bl/6J mice were treated with Vehicle, AICAR, GW1516 and the combination of two drugs for 6 days, followed by collection of quadriceps for gene expression analysis.
 E-GEOD-67520 - Oct4 binding and Histone modification profiling during OSKM-mediated 2nd reprogramming Forced expression of four transcription factors Oct4,Sox2, Klf4 and Myc (OSKM) induces somatic cell reprogramming towards pluripotency.     Major efforts have been made to characterize the molecular events involved in this process.     Yet, it remains elusive how gene expression change, epigenetic landscape remodelling and cell fate conversion are triggered by expression of these Yamanaka factors.To address this gap,we utilized a secondary inducible reprogramming system and performed genome-wide profilings of Oct4 binding, histone modification(H3K4me3/H3K27me3/H3K4me1/H3K27ac), and gene expression analysis during this process.     Through integrative analysis, we revealed stage-specific Oct4 binding and enhancer signatures in consistence with gene expression changes,in which the initial regression of somatic program is followed by the gradual acquisition of pluripotent program.     Oct4 preferatially binds to H3K4me1 marked enhancer regions and Oct4 binding is positively correlated with active mark H3K27ac. Moreover,we observed significant enhancer activation of epigenetic related genes, especially acetylation associated genes, prior to pluripotency network activation, suggesting a pivotal role of epigenetic remodelling in the process of pluripotency acquisition and maintenance.     We used ChIP-seq to explore the global changes of Oct4 binding profiling during OSKM-mediated somatic cell reprogramming.     The exogenous Oct4 was tagged with 3XFlag, thus we used anti-flag antibody to monitor exogenous Oct4 changes; anti-Oct4 antibody which recognizes both endogenous and exogenous Oct4 was used to monitor total Oct4 changes during iPSC induction.     In addition, we also examined genome-wide H3K4me1/H3K27ac/H3K4me3/H3K27me3/RNAPII profiling during 3Flag-OSKM 2' reprogramming.
 E-GEOD-32706 - Comparative transcriptomics and metabolomic analysis of fenofibrate and fish oil treatments in mice Elevated circulating triglycerides, which are considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, can be targeted by treatment with fenofibrate or fish oil.     To gain insight into underlying mechanisms, we carried out a comparative transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis of the effect of 2 week treatment withfenofibrate and fish oil in mice.     Plasma triglycerides were significantly decreased byfenofibrate (-49.1%) and fish oil (-21.8%), whereas plasma cholesterol was increased by fenofibrate (+29.9%) and decreased by fish oil (-32.8%). Levels of various phospholipid species were specifically decreased by fish oil, while levels of Krebs cycle intermediates were increased specifically by fenofibrate.     Plasma levels of many amino acids were altered by fenofibrate and to a lesser extent by fish oil.     Both fenofibrate and fish oil upregulated genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, and downregulated genes involved in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis.     Significant overlap in gene regulation by fenofibrate and fish oil was observed, reflecting their property as high or low affinity agonist for PPARα, respectively.     Fenofibrate specifically downregulated genes involved in complement cascade and inflammatory response.     Fish oil specifically downregulated genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis, and upregulated genes involved in amino acid and arachidonic acid metabolism.     Taken together, the data indicate that despite being similarly potent towards modulating plasma free fatty acids, cholesterol and triglyceride levels, fish oil causes modest changes in gene expression likely via activation of multiple mechanistic pathways, whereas fenofibrate causes pronounced gene expression changes via a single pathway, reflecting the key difference between nutritional and pharmacological intervention.     Expression profiling of liver from mice fed control diet, fish oil or fenofibrate for 2 weeks.
 E-GEOD-45744 - Whole-genome expression data from normal FVB mouse lung tissue, transgenic cyclin E overexpressing (CEO) normal mouse lung tissue, and transgenic CEO lung adenocarcinomas FVB mice were engineered to express wild-type human cyclin E under control of the human surfactant C promoter (CEO mice; Ma et al, PNAS 2007).  These mice develop spontaneous lung tumors, which were shown to be adenocarcinoma by histological analysis.      Here we compare whole-genome RNA expression levels between the tumors and normal lung of 4 CEO mice as well as 4 nontransgenic animals.     RNA was isolated from the lungs of 4 FVB mice and adjacent normal and tumor tissue from 4 FVB transgenes harboring human surfactant protein C- driven wild-type human cyclin E, all 7-11 months in age.      These samples were divided into 3 groups of four, and  12 independent hybridizations were performed for analysis with Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse 430 2.0 arrays.
 E-GEOD-8960 - Transcription profiling of mouse knockouts reveals the TLR2/NOD2/RICK signaling axis regulates stimulus-specific IL-10 production Recognition and response to gram-positive bacteria by macrophages and dendritic cells is mediated in part through TLR2. We found that that Streptococcus pneumoniae cell wall fragments, containing primarily peptidoglycan and teichoic acids, induced prodigious secretion of IL-10 from macrophages and dendritic cells and was dependent on TLR2 and NOD2, a cytoplasmic CARD-NACHT-LRR protein encoded by Card15. IL-10 secretion in response to cell walls was also dependent on RICK/RIP2, a kinase associated with NOD2, and MYD88 but independent of the ERK/p38 pathway.     The reduction of IL-10 secretion by cell wall-activated NOD2-deficient myeloid–derived cells translated into downstream effects on IL-10 target gene expression and elevations in subsets of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression normally restrained by autocrine/paracrine effects of IL-10. Since NOD2 is linked to aberrant immune responses in Crohn’s Disease patients bearing mutations in CARD15, the temporal and quantitative effects of the TLR2/NOD/RICK pathway on IL-10 secretion may affect homeostatic control of immune responses to gram-positive bacteria.     Experiment Overall Design: KO mice were treated with a cel wall extract and evaluated for immune response 1 hr and 4 hrs after treatment
 E-GEOD-23853 - Functional blockade of α5β1 integrin induces scattering and genomic landscape remodeling of hepatic progenitor cells Cells treated with a specific antibody against α5β1 integrin exhibited cell spreading and scattering, over-expression of liver stem/progenitor cell markers and activation of the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPKs signaling cascades, in a similar manner to the process triggered by HGF/SF1 stimulation.     Gene expression profiling revealed marked transcriptional changes of genes involved in cell adhesion and migration, as well as genes encoding chromatin remodeling factors.     These responses were accompanied by conspicuous spatial reorganization of centromeres, while integrin genes conserved their spatial positioning in the interphase nucleus.     Untreated cells versus HGF/SF1 treated or α5β1 integrin-mediated cell migration
 E-GEOD-19709 - Transcriptional Response of Adult Mouse Brain to Hypoxia Since normal brain function depends upon continuous oxygen delivery and short periods of hypoxia can precondition against subsequent ischemia, this study examined the effects of brief hypoxia on the whole genome transcriptional response in adult mouse brain.     Genomic expression profiling was perfromed for individual brain regions of the adult mice following the entire time course of hypoxia preconditioning.     Adult C57BL/6 male mice were exposed to systemic preconditioning hypoxia (8% O2 ) for 3 hr and allowed to recover in normoxia for 24 hr. The mouse brains were removed and dissected into individual brain regions at multiple time points during the 3hr hypoxia and subsequent 24hr reoxygenation periods.     Total RNA was purified from the human whole blood or individual mouse brain regions.     Genomic scale gene expression was then measured with Affymetrix Mouse Expression 430 2.0 arrays.
 E-MTAB-1823 - Genotyping by array of neuro progenitor cells and embryonic stem cells from C57BL6 x CAST hybrid mice Genomic profiling by array to find chromosomic region with aneuploidy in NPC and ESC clones from hybride C57BL5 and CAST mouse
 E-GEOD-47772 - Expression data from subpopulations of Apc1638N/+ intestinal adeno tumors versus Apc1638N/+ / KRAS v12G intestinal adenocarcinomas tumors Constitutive activation of the Wnt pathway leads to adenoma formation, an obligatory step towards intestinal cancer.     In view of the established role of Wnt in regulating stemness, we attempted the isolation of cancer stem cells (CSCs) from Apc- and Apc/KRAS-mutant intestinal tumours.     Whereas CSCs are present in malignant Apc/KRAS–mutant carcinomas, they appear to be very rare ( 10-6) in the benign Apc–mutant adenomas.     In contrast, the Lin-CD24hiCD29+ subpopulation of adenocarcinoma cells appear to be enriched in CSCs with increased levels of active -catenin.     Expression profiling analysis of the CSC-enriched subpopulation confirmed their enhanced Wnt activity and revealed additional differential expression of other signalling pathways, growth factor binding proteins, and extracellular matrix components.     As expected, genes characteristic of the Paneth cell lineage (e.g. defensins) are co-expressed together with stem cell genes (e.g. Lgr5) within the CSC-enriched subpopulation.     This is of interest as it may indicate a cancer stem cell niche role for tumor-derived Paneth-like cells, similar to their role in supporting Lgr5+ stem cells in the normal intestinal crypt.     Overall, our results indicate that oncogenic KRAS activation in Apc-driven tumours results in the expansion of the CSCs compartment by increasing b-catenin intracellular stabilization.     To identify molecular differences between stem-like and more differentiated (bulk) tumour cells from Apc1638N/+ and Apc1638N/+/KRASV12G intestinal adenomas and adenocarcinomas, we isolated total RNA from 104 Lin-CD24hiCD29+, Lin-CD24medCD29+/Lin-CD24loCD29+  and Lin- (bulk) tumour cells from 5 individual mice of each genotype (Apc1638N/+ and Apc1638N/+/KRASV12G). Total RNA samples were then employed to hybridize oligonucleotide microarrays (Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 Array) according to conventional protocols.
 E-GEOD-59201 - Gene expression changes during retinal development and rod specification. Photoreceptor disorders are collectively known as retinal degeneration (RD), and include retinitis pigmentosa (RP), cone-rod dystrophy and age related macular degeneration (AMD). These disorders are largely genetic in origin; individual mutations in any one of  200 genes cause RD, making mutation specific therapies prohibitively expensive.     A better treatment plan, particularly for late stage disease, may involve stem cell transplants into the photoreceptor or ganglion cell layers of the retina.     Stem cells from young mouse retinas can be transplanted, and can form photoreceptors in adult retinas.     These cells can be grown in tissue culture, but can no longer form photoreceptors.     We have used microarrays to investigate differences in gene expression between cultured retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) that have lost photoreceptor potential, postnatal day 1 (pn1) retinas and the postnatal day 5 (pn5) retinas that contain transplantable photoreceptors.     We have also compared FACS sorted Rho-eGFP expressing rod photoreceptors from pn5 retinas with Rho-eGFP negative cells from the same retinas.     We have identified over 300 genes upregulated in rod photoreceptor development in multiple comparisons, 37 of which have been previously identified as causative of retinal disease when mutated.     It is anticipated that this research should bring us closer to growing photoreceptors in culture and therefore better treatments for RD. This dataset is also a resource for those seeking to identify novel retinopathy genes in RD patients.     We extracted whole retinas from postnatal day 1 (Pn1) and postnatal day 5 (Pn5) mice, and compared them with cultured RPCs derived from pn5 retinas, using Affymetrix mouse 430A 2 arrays.     We also extracted cells from Rho-eGFP Pn5 retinas and FACS sorted them.     GFP+ve cells represent immature rod photoreceptors, as they express the Rho-eGFP fusion protein, which is only expressed in rods.     GFP-ve cells represent all other retinal neurons.     These samples were amplified and compared using Affymetrix mouse 430A 2arrays, by Source Biosciences GMBH, Berlin, Germany.     Results from immature rods were then compared with those from other retinal neurons, while results from whole Pn5 retinas were compared with Pn1 retinas (which don't yet express rod specific genes), and RPCs, which are glial precursors.     RPCs were also compared with Pn1 retinas.     Genes which showed changed expression profiles in at least 3/4 of comparisons were prioritised for further investigation.
 E-GEOD-6866 - Transcription profiling of mouse hairless mutant Hos: HR-1 to investigate mechanism alopecia The Hos: HR-1 mouse strain (HR-1) is an autosomal resessive mutant strain which is widely used in pharmacological and dermatological studies in Japan.      Although HR-1 mice have been believed to be Hr gene mutants based on their distinctive alopecia phenotype, there are no reports on either the genetic nature of the Hr gene or mechanism of alopecia.      The present study clarified that the HR-1 mice carry a C to T transition in the Hr gene, which causes a proline to serin amino acid change in the functional domain of translated HR protein.      It is well known that HR plays an important role in hair follicle regression, and loss of HR function triggers distinctive alopecia with the presence of premature apoptosis in the regressing hair follicle.      However, the detailed function of HR protein is still uncertain.      To clarify the mechanism by which HR dysfunction causes hair loss, here we performed microarray analysis on the mRNA samples obtained from the regressing hair follicles of the homozygous (HrHos / HrHos) and heterozygous (+/HrHos, control) Hr mutant mice using laser capture microdissection.      Our results showed increased expression of apoptosis-related and cell-cycle-repressive genes and decreased expression of cell-cycle-promoting genes, suggesting inhibition of the cell cycle at G0/G1.  These findings strongly suggest that the loss of HR function leads to high expression of cell cycle inhibitors, resulting in the hair loss with premature apoptosis in the hair matrix.     Experiment Overall Design: Homozygous (HrHos / HrHos) and heterozygous (+/HrHos) Hr mutant mice of the same N1 littermates obtained from a male Hos: HR-1 mouse and a female heterozygous F1 offspring (+/HrHos) between an HR-1 mouse and an ICR mouse were used at day 14 postpartum.      +/HrHos mice were used as controls because the Hr gene mutantion is autosomal recessive and the morphological appearance of +/HrHos is as same as that of wild-type mice.     Four samples (two from +/HrHos and two from HrHos / HrHos) were analyzed.     All RNA samples were extracted from hair follicles of dorsal skin using Laser capture microdissection.
 E-GEOD-11660 - Oct3/4 expression and notch signaling in bone marrow stromal cells reprogrammed by Xenopus egg extract Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are multipotent stem cells that preferentially differentiate into mesenchymal cells.     If they can be dedifferentiated into embryonic stem cell-like cells, they will be a highly attractive source for cell therapy.     Cell and egg extracts have been used in a few studies to evaluate nuclear reprogramming, but these have not examined cell pluripotency in any detail.     In this study, we used a cell reversible permeabilization method to treat BMSC with Xenopus laevis mitotic egg extract.     We observed an upregulation of the pluripotent protein Oct3/4 in BMSCs treated by this extract.     We also further evaluated transcriptional changes with a focused stem cell oligonucleotide array.     A number of genes involved in the Notch or Wnt signaling pathways were upregulated in BMSC exposed to Xenopus egg extract.     In conclusion, our microarray data from BMSCs exposure to egg extracts may provide interesting clues regarding factors involved in nuclear reprogramming.     Our approach is an alternative method towards dedifferentiation of cells without genetic modification, which is preferable in the clinical situation.      Keywords: Cell type comparison Expression profiling was performed on murine bonemarrow stromal cells cultured in-vitro versus stromal cells exposed to Xenopus extract and compared with murine embryonic stem cells
 E-GEOD-29348 - Gene expression profiling in WT and Alox15-/- HSCs To understand the underlying mechanism by which Alox15 gene is required by HSCs, we performed a comparative DNA microarray analysis using total RNA isolated from wild type Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+, Alox5-/- Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+. The result was validated by quantitative real-time PCR analysis of wild type Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+ and Alox15-/- Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+. Cancer stem cells are responsible for the initiation and maintenance of some types of cancer, and few effective target genes in these stem cells have been identified.     Here we show that the arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase gene (Alox15) is essential for the survival of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in BCR-ABL-induced chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In the absence of Alox15, BCR-ABL failed to induce CML in mice.     This Alox15 deficiency caused the impairment of LSC function through affecting cell division and apoptosis, leading to eventual deletion of LSCs. Inhibition of Alox15 function by a chemical compound also impaired the function of LSCs, and cured CML mice.     In addition, we show that Alox15 is required for the survival of human CD34+ CML stem cells.     The defective CML phenotype in the absence of Alox15 is rescued by depleting P-selectin.     The underlying mechanisms are also related to pathways involving PTEN, PI3K/AKT, and ICSBP. These results identify Alox15 as a potential target gene for eradicating LSCs in CML, providing a novel strategy for treating CML patients for cure.     we compared the gene profile of HSCs between WT mice  and Alox15-/- mice.
 E-GEOD-5394 - Transcription profiling of mouse with unilateral cochlear removal in Cochlear Nucleus at P7 and P21 Deprivation of peripheral nerve input by cochlear removal in young mice results in dramatic neuron death in the cochlear nucleus (CN).  The same manipulation in older mice does not result in significant loss.      The molecular basis of this critical period of vulnerability remains largely unknown.      Here we identified genes regulated at early time points after cochlear removal at ages when neurons are vulnerable (postnatal day (P)7) or invulnerable (P21) to this challenge.      Afferent deprivation regulated very different sets of genes at P7 and P21.  These genes showed a variety of functions at both ages, but surprisingly there was no net increase in pro-apoptotic genes at P7.   A large set of upregulated immune-related genes was identified at P21. Experiment Overall Design: Mice received unilateral cochlear removals.      At 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after surgery, the CN ipsilateral and contralateral were removed, and RNA isolated from separate pools of tissue for each replicate.      Deafferented CN were compared to age-matched and time-matched contralateral, control CN to identify genes regulated by cochlear removal at age P7 and P21.
 E-GEOD-22798 - Expression data from Pax7+ satellite cell derived tumors in vitro and in vivo Mouse muscle stem cells, defined as Pax7+ satellite cells, can initiate rhabdomyosarcoma when transformed by oncogenic Kras and concomitant loss of p53. Mouse Pax7+ satellite cells were transformed in vitro and in vivo utilizing the Cre-ER/loxp system.     We wanted to address two major questions: do the in vitro and in vivo tumors cluster together compared to another mouse to another mouse derived soft-tissue sarcoma AND which human soft-tissue sarcoma do the in vivo derived tumors resemble transcriptionally?  Therefore, tumors from cells transformed in vitro and tumors from mice that restrict the oncogenic lesions to Pax7+ satellite cells in vivo were compared to answer these two questions.
 E-GEOD-2644 - Transcription profiling of livers from Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor null mice expressing human LXR alpha to explore the molecular basis of metabolic effects of increased hepatic hLXR alpha. Microarray analysis of liver RNA from male Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor null mice on C57B6 background expressing human LXR alpha or GFP (control) via adeno-associated virus (AAV2.8) gene transfer, under control of the liver specific human thyroxine binding globulin promoter.     Samples are from 8 month old mice, with AAV treatment at age of 10 weeks, on Western diet for 12 weeks prior experiment.     The synthetic LXR ligand T0901317 (5mg/kg) or vehicle was administered for 3 days by i.p. injection to designated mice.
 E-MIMR-282 - Transcription profiling of mouse leydig tumor cell line stimulated with either human chorionic gonadotropin alone or with bisphenol A, an endrocrine disrupting chemical A mouse leydig tumour cell line (mLTC-1) was grown in culture and stimulated with either human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, 10 ng/ml) alone or hCG & bisphenol A (BPA, an endrocrine disrupting chemical, 10 uM) for three hours.      Cells from triplicate plates were harvested, RNA extracted, labelled and hybridised to Affymetrix Mouse genome 430 2.0 arrays.      Preliminary work by RT-PCR had shown that stimulation of the cell line by BPA resulted in changes in gene expression in the spermatogenesis pathway at this time point.
 E-GEOD-67884 - Furin deficiency efect on T cells Analysis of T-cells lacking the proprotein convertase furin.     Proprotein convertases promote the proteolytic maturation of proproteins.     Furin is induced in activated T-cells.     Results provide insight into the function of furin in T-cells.     CD4+CD62L+CD44- naive, CD4+CD62L-CD44+ memory and CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells were isolated from Fur flox/flox and CD4 cre Fur flox/flox mice.     Naive T cells were activated via TCR. Total RNA was extracted from all cells and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays.
 E-GEOD-41492 - Sequential induction of effector function, tissue migration and cell death during polyclonal activation of regulatory T-cells The ability of Treg-cells to produce interleukin-10 (IL-10) is important for the limitation of  inflammation at environmental interfaces like colon or lung.     Under steady state conditions, however,  only few Treg-cells produce IL-10 ex vivo.     To investigate the origin and fate of IL-10 producing Tregcells  we used a superagonistic mouse anti-mouse CD28 mAb (CD28SA) for polyclonal in vivo  stimulation of Treg-cells, which not only led to numeric expansion but also to a dramatic increase in IL-  10 production.     IL-10 secreting Treg-cells strongly upregulated surface receptors associated with  suppressive function, and had higher but IL-10 independent, in vitro suppressive capacity than nonproducing  Treg-cells.     Furthermore, polyclonally expanding Treg-cells shifted their migration receptor  pattern after activation from a lymph node-seeking to an inflammation-seeking phenotype, explaining  the preferential recruitment of IL-10 producers to sites of ongoing immune responses.     Finally, we  observed that IL-10 producing Treg-cells from CD28SA stimulated mice were more apoptosis-prone in  vitro than their IL-10 negative counterparts.     These findings support a model where prolonged activation  of Treg-cells results in terminal differentiation towards an IL-10 producing effector phenotype  associated with a limited lifespan, implicating built-in termination of immunosuppression.     total samples analysed are 4
 E-GEOD-7275 - Transcription profiling of mouse mast cells derived exosomal RNA versus their parental cells MC/9. Exosomes are vesicles of endocytic origin released by many types of cells into the extracellular environment.     In an attempt to further examine the exosome-mediated cellular communication, we show that exosomes from a mouse mast cell line (MC/9), exosomes from primary bone marrow derived mast cells, and exosomes from a human mast cell line (HMC-1) contain RNA but not DNA. Microarray assessments of exosome-derived RNA revealed that these vesicles contain mRNA from approximately 1200 genes, many of which are unique and not present in the cytoplasmic RNA pool in the donor cell.     Experiment Overall Design: Exosomes were prepared from the supernatant of MC/9 cells by differential centrifugations and filtration.     RNA was isolated from the exosomes and their parental cells using Trizo.     The microarray experiments were performed by SweGene (www.swegene.org/) according to Affymetrix microarray DNA chip analysis.     The experiment was performed in quadruple samples.     ExoRNA1, ExoRNA2, ExoRNA3, and ExoRNA4 for the exosomes samples and Mast cells1, Mast cells2, Mast cells3, and Mast cells4 for the MC/9 cells.
 E-GEOD-19997 - POU4F1 is associated with t(8;21) AML and contributes directly to its unique transcriptional signature POU4F1 is associated with t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and contributes directly to its unique transcriptional signature To identify targets of POU4F1, we performed gene expression profiling, comparing Pou4f1+/+ or Pou4f1-/- fetal liver cells to cells overexpressing POU4F1 and identified 140 differentially expressed genes.
 E-MEXP-3786 - Transcription profiling by array of mouse male retinas to investugate IGF-I-induced chronic gliosis and retinal stress IGF-I exert multiple effects in different retinal cell populations in both physiological and pathological conditions.     Transgenic mice overexpressing IGF-I in the retina showed impaired electroretinographic responses at 6-7 months of age that worsen with age.     This retinal neuronal dysfunction was correlated with the loss of rod photoreceptors, bipolar, ganglion and amacrines cells.     Neuronal alterations were preceded by the overexpression of  retinal stress markers, acute phase proteins and gliosis-related genes.     IGF-I overexpression leads to chronic gliosis and microgliosis in TgIGF-I retinas, with mild oxidative stress, impaired recycling of glutamate and defective potassium buffering.     These impaired supportive functions can contribute to neurodegeneration in TgIGF-I retinas, together with the increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, potential mediators of neuronal death.
 E-GEOD-22925 - Murine Bone Marrow Stromal Cell Response to Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor Neutrophil homeostasis is maintained, in part, by the regulated release of neutrophils from the bone marrow.      Constitutive expression of the chemokine CXCL12 by bone marrow stromal cells provides a key retention signal for neutrophils in the bone marrow through activation of its receptor CXCR4.  Herein, we show that the ELR chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL2 are constitutively expressed by bone marrow endothelial cells and osteoblasts, and CXCL2 expression is induced in endothelial cells during granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-induced neutrophil mobilization.     Neutrophils lacking CXCR2, the receptor for CXCL1 and CXCL2, are preferentially retained in the bone marrow, reproducing a myelokathexis phenotype.      Transient disruption of CXCR4 failed to mobilize CXCR2 neutrophils.      However, doubly deficient neutrophils (CXCR2-/- CXCR4-/-) displayed constitutive mobilization, showing that CXCR4 plays a dominant role.     Collectively, these data suggest that CXCR2 signaling is a second chemokine axis that interacts antagonistically with CXCR4 to regulate neutrophil release from the bone marrow.     We used gene expression microarrays to determine the changes in osteoblasts and bone marrow endothelial cells after G-CSF treatment.     3 untreated and G-CSF-treated osteoblast samples and 4 untreated and G-CSF-treated endothelial samples.
 E-GEOD-33031 - PU.1 restricts adult hematopoietic stem cell proliferation via cell specific autoregulation To guarantee blood supply throughout adult life hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) need to carefully balance between self-renewing cell divisions and quiescence.     Identification of genes controlling HSC self-renewal is of utmost importance given that HSCs are the only stem cells with broad clinical applications.     Transcription factor PU.1 is one of the major regulators of myeloid and lymphoid development.     Recent reports suggest that PU.1 mediates its functions via gradual expression level changes rather than binary on/off states.     So far, this has not been considered in any study of HSCs and thus, PU.1’s role in HSC function has remained largely unclear.     Here we demonstrate using hypomorphic mice with an engineered disruption of an autoregulatory feedback loop that decreased PU.1 levels resulted in loss of key HSC functions, all of which could be fully rescued by restoration of proper PU.1 levels via a human PU.1 transgene.     Mechanistically, we found excessive HSC cell divisions and altered expression of cell cycle regulators whose promoter regions were bound by PU.1 in normal HSCs. Adequate PU.1 levels were maintained by a mechanism of direct autoregulation restricted to HSCs through a physical interaction of a -14kb enhancer with the proximal promoter.     Our findings identify PU.1 as novel regulator controling the switch between cell division and quiescence in order to prevent exhaustion of HSCs. Given that even moderate level changes greatly impact stem cell function, our data suggest important therapeutic implications for leukemic patients with reduced PU.1 levels.     Moreover, we provide first proof, that autoregulation of a transcription factor, PU.1, has a crucial function in vivo.     We anticipate that our concept of how autoregulation forms an active chromosomal conformation will impact future research on transcription factor networks regulating stem cell fate.     HSCs of Pu.1 knock-in (PU.1ki/ki) mice were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.     We compared these microarray samples with the corresponding wild type.
 E-GEOD-60566 - Disruption of transkingdom communication by antibiotics leads to immune and mitochondrial dysfunction in the gut (main) We analyzed the effects of antibiotics using a popular model of gut microbiota depletion in mice by a cocktail of antibiotics.     We combined intestinal transcriptome together with metagenomic analysis of the gut microbiota to develop a new bioinformatics approach that probes the links between microbial components and host functions.     We found that most antibiotic-induced alterations can be explained by three factors: depletion of the microbiota; direct effects of antibiotics on host tissues; and the effects of remaining antibiotic-resistant microbes.     While microbe depletion led to down-regulation of immunity, the two other factors primarily inhibited mitochondrial gene expression and amounts of active mitochondria, and induced cell death.     By reconstructing and analyzing a transkingdom network, we discovered that these toxic effects were mediated by virulence/quorum sensing in antibiotic-resistant bacteria.        This series includes gene expression in the ileum of control, antibiotics (ABx)-treated, germfree, germfree-ABx-treated and mice colonized with normal or Abx-resistant microbiota.     common reference design with a pool of small intestine RNA labeled with Cy3
 E-GEOD-20562 - Expression data in mouse liver exposed to low dose-rate radiation Expression profiles in mouse liver exposed to long-term gamma-irradiation were examined to assess in vivo effects of low dose-rate radiation.     Three groups of male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to whole body irradiation at dose-rates of 17-20 mGy/day, 0.86-1.0 mGy/day or 0.042-0.050 mGy/day for 401-485 days (cumulative doses were approximately 8 Gy, 0.4 Gy or 0.02 Gy, respectively). Expression profiles were produced for RNA isolated from irradiated individual animals and for pooled RNA from sham-irradiated 3 animals for control.     The expression levels of 6 irradiated animals for each dose were compared individually with those of 2 pooled controls (3 irradiated samples to one pooled control in first and second experiments). The experiments were conducted twice at similar dose-rates.     In the first experiment, three groups of 8 weeks old male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to whole body irradiation at dose-rates of either 16.6 mGy/day (H1), 0.858 mGy/day (M1) or 0.042 mGy/day (L1) for 485 days (cumulative doses were 8030 mGy, 416 mGy or 20.6 mGy, respectively). In the second experiment, the doe-rates were slightly elevated as 20.0 mGy/day (H2), 1.000 mGy/day (M2) or 0.050 mGy/day (L2) for 401 days (doses were 8015 mGy, 401 mGy or 20 mGy, respectively). A group of control unirradiated mice were set for each experiment (C1, C2).
 E-GEOD-9018 - Transcription profiling of mouse small intestine from wildtype B6, Rag1-/- B6 and Rag1-/- B6 mice harboring the 225.4 IgA producing hybridoma after infection with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Wildtype B6, Rag1-/- B6 and Rag1-/- B6 mice harboring the 225.4 IgA producing hybridoma were colonized for 10 days with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Experiment Overall Design: Distal small intestine segments were snap frozen immediately after the mice were sacrificed, and small intestine divided into 16 equal segments, segments 10, 11, 12 and 14 were pooled and RNA extracted.
 E-GEOD-65888 - In vivo electroporation-based conditional oncogenic activation implicates multiple distinct cellular origins for Group3 medulloblastoma We examined the transformation susceptibility of different cerebellar stem/progenitors by developing several new Group3 medulloblastoma murine models using orthotopic transplantation and in utero electroporation (EP)-based in vivo gene transfer with Cre/LoxP-mediated conditional Myc gene activation and loss of Trp53 function.     We used microarrays to compared the transcriptome of these novel Group3 medulloblastoma mouse models to existing mouse models of medulloblastoma subgroups and used cross-species analysis to compare these models to human medulloblastoma subgroups This study aimed to investigate the cell of origin of Group3 MB using our orthotopical MYC model followed by a novel electroporation approach.     Orthotopic cell-lineage specific MYC tumors were generated by enforced Myc expression in P6 GNPs isolated from P0-1 tamoxifen treated [Atoh1-CreER;Trp53fl/-] and [Prom1-CreER;Trp53fl/-] mice followed by cortical implants in immunocompromised mice.     These tumors are referred to as Atoh1ER-MYC [dka072-075], Prom1-CreER [dka077-081]. The first Group3 MB models in which tumors developed in situ were generated by electroporation of plasmids containing Myc and dominant negative Trp53 flanked by loxP sites into the fourth ventricle of E13.5 Blbp-Cre [dka081, 087, 089, 090, 091 and blm121], Gad2-IRES-Cre [blm128-130 and blm134] and Ptf1a-Cre [blm135-137] mouse embryos.     The gene expression profile of these tumors were compared to our previously published Group3 MB model as well as SHH and WNT models of medulloblastoma.     For SHH subgroup medulloblastoma, [dka001-005, 009, 033 and 034] and [dka050-057], spontaneous medulloblastomas from [Cdkn2c-/-; Trp53Fl/Fl; Nestin-Cre] and [Cdkn2c-/-; Ptch1+/-] (Uziel et al.,2005 Genes Dev) were used, respectively.     For Group3 medulloblastomas, [dka013-16, 049 and 065-067], in which Myc was overexpressed in Cdkn2c-/-, Trp53-/- cerebellar cells and implanted into the cortices of immunocompromised nude mice prior to tumor isolation.     For WNT subgroup medulloblastomas [pgr003, 016 and 066], spontaneously developed tumors from CTNNB1+/lox (ex3); BLBP-Cre; Trp53Fl/Fl (Gibson et al., 2010, Nature) were removed for RNA extraction.
 E-GEOD-29648 - The impact of a phytoestrogen-rich diet on cardiac gene expression in the context of HCM A soy diet worsens the progression of an inherited form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in male mice when compared to casein-fed mice.     Females are largely resistant to this diet effect and better preserve cardiac function.     We hypothesized that the abundant phytoestrogens found in soy are mainly responsible for this diet-dependent phenotype.     Indeed, feeding male mice a phytoestrogen-supplemented casein-based diet can recapitulate the negative outcome seen when male mice are fed a standard soy-based diet.     To gain mechanistic insights into disease pathogenesis, we used Affymetrix microarrays to profile gene expression in left ventricular tissue from 2 month old HCM male and female mice as well as wild-type littermate controls.     These mice were fed a phytoestrogen (genistein + daidzein)-supplemented casein-based diet.     We identified a number of molecular pathways that could explain both the male and female phenotypes.     Hearts from male and female wild-type or HCM C57BL/6 mice fed a phytoestrogen-supplemented (genistein and daidzein mix) casein-based diet were excised at 2 months of age.     Total RNA was extracted from left ventricles.     Biotin-labeled amplified RNA was hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 microarrays.
 E-GEOD-28093 - Expression profile of OPC senescence To identify factors involved in OPC senescence, we compared gene expressions between OPC-CG4, OPC-FCS and OPC-Rev. We established OPC senescence model system, in which OPC become senescent in the presence of high concentration of FCS. This phenotypes were kept even when the medium was switched to their optimal serum-free medium.
 E-GEOD-17115 - Gene Expression upon Doxorubicin Treatments Murine C26 tumor xenografts displayed different responses to the treatments of PBS, Doxorubicin (Dox), and chimeric polypeptide (CP)-Dox conjugates.     We used microarrays to globally study gene expression underlying these different responses and identified distinct classes of up-regulated or down-regulated genes upon treatment.     C26 murine colon carcinoma xenografts were analyzed at 48 hours after treatment with CP-Dox, free Dox, and PBS (control). This study involved four replicates of each treatment.
 E-GEOD-23628 - Sleep Deprivation and Recovery Sleep for 7 Regions of Mouse Brain. Analysis of the effects of sleep deprivation, recovery sleep, and three time-of-day controls on seven brain regions laser microdissected from mouse brain.     The regions include the locus coeruleus, suprachiasmatic nucleus, hypocretin area, tuberomammillary nucleus, orbital cortex, posteromedial cortical amygdala, and entorhinal cortex.     In this study, 7 brain regions were collected by laser microdissection from brain tissue of mice from 5 different treatment groups and used for microarray experiments.     Four biological replicates were generated for each regionxcondition.     Conditions are: SD, sleep deprivation for 6 hours from ZT0 - 6; SDC, time-of-day control for SD at ZT6; RS, recovery sleep for 4 hours following SD; RSC, time-of-day control for RS at ZT10; W, spontaneous waking at ZT18.
 E-GEOD-37029 - Microarray analysis of WT bone marrow myeloid progenitors, BM cultured with GM-CSF and M-CSF, and monocytes treated with GM-CSF Analysis of genes induced in DC precursors and in BM cells and monocytes treated with GM-CSF For progenitor arrays, bone marrow progenitors (CMP, GMP, CDP, and pre-cDC) were harvested from WT C57Bl/6 mice.      For culture arrays, BM was cultured in the presence of GM-CSF or M-CSF and adherent and non-adherent cells sorted.      For monocyte cultures, sorted BM monocytes were treated with GM-CSF for 0, 24 or 48 hours.
 E-GEOD-51635 - Stem Cell Quiescence acts as a tumor suppressor mechanism in hair follicle initiated squamous tumors In some organs, adult stem cells are uniquely poised to serve as cancer cells of origin1-4.  It is unclear, however, whether tumorigenesis is influenced by the activation state of the adult stem cell.      Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) act as cancer cells of origin for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and undergo defined cycles of quiescence and activation.      The data presented here show that HFSCs are unable to initiate tumors during the quiescent phase of the hair cycle, indicating that the mechanisms that keep HFSCs dormant are dominant to the gain of oncogenes (Ras) or the loss of tumor suppressors (p53). Furthermore, Pten activity is necessary for quiescence based tumor suppression, as its deletion alleviates tumor suppression  without affecting proliferation.      These data demonstrate that stem cell quiescence is a form of tumor suppression in HFSCs, and that Pten plays a role in maintaining quiescence in the presence of tumorigenic stimuli.     This experiment includes RNA profiling of hair follicle stem cells at various stages of tumorigenesis Briefly: HFSCs were lineage traced with YFP allele, FACS isolated from various genotypes, and then profiled by Affymetrix microarray Cell Isolation and FACS: Whole dorsal and ventral mouse K15-CrePR; LSLYFP, K15-CrePR; KrasG12D; LSLYFP and K15-CrePR; KrasG12D; Ptenff; LSLYFP was extracted, diced and digested with collagenase (20mg/ml) for 2 hours at 37C, then an equal volume of .25% trypsin was added and digestion continued for an additional hour at 37C.  Digested tissue was mechanically dispersed via pipette and filtered with a 100uM cell strainer, collected at 300g and washed twice with PBS. The cells were then filtered through a 40uM cell strainer and FACS processed.      YFP+ and YFP- cell populations were collected in RNA lysis buffer (Stratagene) and stored at -80C. Gene expression profiling Microarray analyses by GeneSpring software were performed
 E-GEOD-74306 - Mouse Dendritic Cells Expression Data Dendritic cells (DC) play a vital role in the induction of activation or tolerance of immune response.      Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors potently modulate experimental graft-vs-host disease, allograft rejection, and autoimmune diseases, partly through the regulation of dendritic cells.     The molecular mechanisms underpinning their immunosuppressive effects on DCs are not well understood.     The functional relevance of acetylation in DC responses remains undefined.     We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression in dendritic cells after treated with or without SAHA, a HDAC inhibitor utilized in clinic, to identify the upregulated and downregulated genes.     To obtain overall gene expression profile, we extracted bone marrow cells from at least 3 mice for each experiment.      Purified (95% purity) mouse dendritic cells were treated with SAHA (500 nm for 12 hours) or control diluent, then used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
 E-GEOD-34126 - An Animal Model of Myc-driven medulloblastoma Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor in children.     Patients whose tumors exhibit overexpression or amplification of the MYC oncogene (c-MYC) usually have an extremely poor prognosis, but there are no animal models of this subtype of the disease.     Here we show that cerebellar stem cells expressing Myc and mutant Trp53 (p53) generate aggressive tumors following orthotopic transplantation.     These tumors consist of large, pleiomorphic cells and resemble human MYC-driven MB at a molecular level.     Notably, antagonists of PI3K/mTOR signaling, but not Hedgehog signaling, inhibit growth of tumor cells.     These findings suggest that cerebellar stem cells can give rise to MYC-driven MB, and identify a novel model that can be used to test therapies for this devastating disease.     To gain insight into the pathways that control growth of MYC-driven MB, we compared gene expression profiles of murine Myc/DNp53 (MP) tumor cells to those of freshly isolated cerebellar stem cells (Prom1+Lin- cells) and of tumors from Ptch1 mutant mice (a model for Sonic Hedgehog-associated MB). RNA was isolated from stem cells and tumor cells using the RNAqueous kit (Ambion). RNA was labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays.     19 mouse cell samples (stem cells and tumor cells) were analyzed.     There are four groups of samples, three with five biological replicates and the last with four (one outlier was removed).  To gain insight into the mechanisms of transformation into tumors, we compared the gene expression profiles of MP tumor cells derived from stem cells (Myc/DNp53-infected Prom1+Lin- cells, designated MP-pl) or progenitors (Myc/DNp53-infected Prom1+ cells, designated MP-p) to gene expression profiles of uninfected stem cells (designated NSC) and profiles from a distinct model of medulloblastoma, the patched mutant mouse (designated ptch1).
 E-GEOD-37397 - Global Transcriptional Analysis of Nuclear Reprogramming in the Transition from MEFs to iPSCs Here, we focused on the intermediate stages of SCR by comparing the somatic cell line induced by OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4 (OSK) for 7 days with mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), iPSCs, and embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Transcriptional profiles of these four cell lines were analyzed by microarray, and we found that the transition process from day 7 to the formation of iPSCs is crucial for SCR and that the reverse expression patterns can provide more candidate markers to distinguish ESCs and somatic cells iPSC. Data confirmed that the viral infection results in defense innate immunity, DNA damage, and apoptosis in MEFs, which slows down cell proliferation and immortalization to inhibit SCR. Although SCR is initiated by OSK, the p53 signaling pathway can affect the transcriptional regulatory networks through cell cycle and genomic instability as a powerful core node.     MEFs were derived from embryonic day 13.5 C57BL6 mice embryos.     Cell line day7 is MEF induced by OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4 (OSK) for 7 days with mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), iPSCs, and embryonic stem cells (ESCs).
 E-GEOD-25438 - Gene expression data in murine nasal mucosa following nanoemulsion adjuvant exposure Antigen uptake, processing, trafficking and presentation in nasal mucosal tissues are regulated by complex intra- and inter-cellular signalling events.      Typical vaccine adjuvants lead to the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines which relate to immune induction.     We used microarrays to detail the global expression of genes in murine nasal mucosa underlying immune induction with a non-inflammatory nanoemulsion nasal adjuvant.     8 week old female CD-1 mice were nasally treated with 5 microliters/nare of either  20% (v/v) naomeulsion (W805EC) or PBS.  Nasal epithelium was harvested immediately post-mortem at either 6 (6 hr) or 24 hours (24 hr) following treatment.      The tissue was placed in OTC and frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen.      Total RNA was extracted per sample using RNA easy (Qiagen).
 E-GEOD-8818 - Transcription profiling of mouse intestinal crypts upon deletion of beta-catenin The Wnt signaling pathway is deregulated in over 90% of human colorectal cancers.     β Catenin, the central signal transducer of the Wnt pathway, can directly modulate gene expression by interacting with transcription factors of the TCF/LEF-family.     In the present study we investigate the role of Wnt signaling in the homeostasis of intestinal epithelium using tissue-specific, inducible beta-catenin gene ablation in adult mice.     Block of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling resulted in rapid loss of transient-amplifying cells and crypt structures.     Importantly, intestinal stem cells were induced to terminally differentiate upon deletion of beta-catenin resulting in a complete block of intestinal homeostasis and fatal loss of intestinal function.     Transcriptional profiling of mutant crypt mRNA isolated by laser capture micro dissection confirmed those observations and allowed to identify genes potentially responsible for the functional preservation of intestinal stem cells.     Experiment Overall Design: laser capture microdissection of intestinal crypts, control vs. beta-catenin mutant (2days after induction of deletion by tamoxifen), two rounds of amplification of mRNA
 E-GEOD-13948 - Transcription profiling of mouse after antagonism of microRNA-122 by systemically administered LNA-antimiR Antagonism of microRNA-122 in mice by systemically administered LNA-antimiR leads to up-regulation of a large set of predicted target mRNAs in the liver; MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) is an abundant liver-specific miRNA, implicated in fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism as well as hepatitis C viral replication.     Here, we report that a systemically administered 16-nt, unconjugated LNA (locked nucleic acid)-antimiR oligonucleotide complementary to the 5' end of miR-122 leads to specific, dose-dependent silencing of miR-122 and shows no hepatotoxicity in mice.     Antagonism of miR-122 is due to formation of stable heteroduplexes between the LNA-antimiR and miR-122 as detected by northern analysis.     Fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated uptake of the LNA-antimiR in mouse liver cells, which was accompanied by markedly reduced hybridization signals for mature miR-122 in treated mice.     Functional antagonism of miR-122 was inferred from a low cholesterol phenotype and de-repression within 24 h of 199 liver mRNAs showing significant enrichment for miR-122 seed matches in their 3' UTRs. Expression profiling extended to 3 weeks after the last LNA-antimiR dose revealed that most of the changes in liver gene expression were normalized to saline control levels coinciding with normalized miR-122 and plasma cholesterol levels.     Combined, these data suggest that miRNA antagonists comprised of LNA are valuable tools for identifying miRNA targets in vivo and for studying the biological role of miRNAs and miRNA-associated gene-regulatory networks in a physiological context.     Experiment Overall Design: Female NMRI mice were treated at day 2 with either 25mg/kg antimiR-122 (SPC3372) or vehicle (saline). Mice were sacrificied at day 3, 9 and 23 and liver RNA assayed.     Three biological replicates for each of the six groups.
 E-GEOD-992 - Transcriptional changes in mouse extensor digitorum longus following lengthening contractions I.  Experimental Design: a. Type of experiment:  Time course b. Experimental factors:  3 month old mice subjected to lengthening contractions of the extensor digitorum longus muscle (EDL).  Samples of EDL collected at 6 and 72 h and compared to non-treated control.     c.  How many hybridizations in exp: 9 d.  Common reference used for all hyb: no e.  Quality control steps:  All arrays used from same lot.      Triplicate hybridizations performed for each time point.       II. Samples used, extracts, preparation and labeling: Animals.      Nine male C57BL/6 mice (3-4 mo of age, 27.8 ± 3.3 g body mass, Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN). Muscle Injury.      The extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle of six mice were exposed to lengthening contractions.      Mice were anesthetized with 2% avertin (0.015 ml/kg) and supplemental doses were administered if the mouse responded to a toe pinch.      Animals were placed on a plexiglass platform that was maintained at 37°C.  The distal femur of the right hindlimb was fixed between screws and the foot was taped to the platform.      The distal tendons of the EDL were exposed by incision and tied to the lever arm of a servomotor (Aurora Scientific, Richmond Hill ON, Canada) with 4-0 silk suture.      Needle electrodes were placed adjacent to the peroneal nerve to stimulate dorsiflexor contraction (Grass Instruments, West Warwick, RI).  Maximal isometric force (Po) was determined by stimulating the dorsiflexors maximally at optimum length (Lo) for force development.     To induce muscle injury, 75 lengthening contractions were performed at 0.25 Hz for 5 min.      For each lengthening contraction, the muscle was stimulated at 150 Hz and stretched 100 ms after the initiation of stimulation.      Muscle stretch involved 20 % strain relative to Lo.  Force deficit was evaluated 10 min after the 75 contractions and then the incision was closed with 7-0 silk suture.      Animals were returned to their cage to recover until the time of sacrifice.      Prior to sacrifice by cervical dislocation, animals were anesthetized with avertin and the EDL muscles were excised and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.      Muscles were stored in liquid nitrogen until RNA isolation.     RNA Isolation.      Total RNA was isolated from EDL muscles from control mice (n=3) and mice sacrificed at 6 h (n=3) and 72 h (n=3) after lengthening contractions according to the modified protocol of  Chomzynski et al..  Frozen muscles were added to preweighed tubes containing TriReagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).  Tissue was homogenized in TriReagent using a Tissue Tearor (Fischer, Pittsburgh, PA) at 30,000 rpm for 1 minute.      Homogenates were transferred to sterile, RNAase free microcentrifuge tubes and incubated for 10 min at room temperature.      Chloroform (0.2 ml; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was added and after incubation, the samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 g and 4°C.  Total RNA was precipitated from the aqueous phase by the addition of isopropanol (Sigma-Aldrich), and pelleted by centrifugation.      Pellets were washed in ethanol (75 and 95 %) and air dried before resuspension in diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) treated water.      RNA concentration was determined by optical density at 260 nm.  III. Hybridization procedures and parameters: Microarray Hybridization and Analysis.      To reduce measurement error, all membranes (Atlas mouse 1.2; Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) were prepared from the same lot.      Additionally, each membrane was hybridized only once to avoid errors associated with stripping and multiple hybridizations.      In order to minimize individual biological variability, total RNA was pooled from three animals for hybridization of arrays.      Three arrays were used for the pooled sample at each time point.      First strand cDNA probe generation from total RNA and microarray hybridization were performed according to manufacturer’s instructions (Atlas cDNA Expression Arrays User Manual, Clontech).  33P labeled cDNA was generated from sample RNA using [33P]-dATP (3000 Ci/mmol; ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) and Maloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase (Clontech).  Labeled probes were purified using nucleospin columns (Clontech). Array membranes were prehybridized in Express Hyb containing sheared Salmon testes DNA (Gibco BRL, Rockville, MD) for 30 min at 71°C in rotating hybridization tubes.      Radiolabeled probe (3 x 106 cpm) was incubated in denaturing solution (Clontech) for 20 min at 71°C, after which Cot1 DNA/neutralizing solution was added and incubation continued for 10 min.      The probe mixture was added to the hybridization tube and incubated with rotation overnight.     Following hybridization, membranes were washed four times for 30 min in 2X saturated sodium citrate (SSC) and 1 % sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) at 71°C, once for 30 min in 0.1X SSC and 0.5% SDS at 71°C, and once for 5 min in 2X SSC at room temperature.      Membranes were removed and immediately wrapped in plastic and exposed to a phosphor storage screen (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) for four days.      IV. Measurement data and specifications: Data Analysis.      The membrane image was acquired using a Storm phosporimager (Molecular Dynamics) and Image Quant software.      Array images were analyzed using Atlas Image 2.0 (Clontech) software to determine raw intensity levels of expression.      Raw intensity data was imported into GeneSpring (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA) expression analysis software.      Intensity levels were normalized to the median expressed intensity on each of the arrays and averaged for the three arrays at each time point.      Normalized expression levels for control arrays were established as a value of 1 and data from 6 and 72 h were expressed as fold changes relative to control.     In order to simplify interpretation of the resulting dataset, a k-means cluster analysis was employed to group genes based on similarities in patterns of expression.     To reduce the likelihood of false positives, the data was filtered using a criterion 2 fold change in expression prior to clustering.      Miller et al. (61) have calculated that using an array of 10,000 features with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 20 percent, a 2 fold criterion for altered gene expression would result in zero false positives.      The mean and median CV (15.8 and 14.3%, respectively) for all arrays in the current study fell within these guidelines for the elimination of false positives.
 E-GEOD-43377 - Mouse Diversity Array SNP Genotyping of B10.BALBChr16 and BALB.B10Chr16 Reciprocal Consomic Strain Mice To identify novel mechanisms regulating allogeneic hematopoietic cell engraftment, we previously used a forward genetic approach and described identification, in mice, of the Bmgr5 bone marrow (BM) engraftment quantitative trait locus (QTL).  This QTL confers dominant and large allele effects for engraftment susceptibility.      It was localized to chromosome 16 by classical quantitative genetic techniques in a segregating backcross bred from susceptible BALB.K and resistant B10.BR mice.      We now report verification of the Bmgr5 QTL using reciprocal chromosome 16 consomic strains.      The BM engraftment phenotype in these consomic mice shows that Bmgr5 susceptibility alleles are not only sufficient but also indispensable for conferring permissiveness for allogeneic BM engraftment.      Using panels of congenic mice, we resolved the Bmgr5 QTL into two separate subloci, termed Bmgr5a and Bmgr5b, each conferring permissiveness for the engraftment phenotype and both fine mapped to an interval amenable to positional cloning.      Candidate Bmgr5 genes were then prioritized using whole exome DNA sequencing and microarray gene expression profiling.      Further studies are needed to elucidate the genetic interaction between Bmgr5a and Bmgr5b and identify causative genes and underlying gene variants.      This may lead to new approaches for overcoming the problem of graft rejection in clinical hematopoietic cell transplantation.     B10.BALBChr16 and BALB.B10Chr16 consomic strain mice were constructed in our laboratory for validation of bone marrow engraftment and graft-vs-host diseaes QTLs.  The parental strains for consomic line construction were B10.BR (B10.BR-H2k H2-T18a/SgSnJJrep) and BALB.K (C.C3-H2k/LilMcdJ).  The JAX Mouse Diveristy 620K SNP Array was used to verify adequate removal of residual background heterozygosity.      Liver DNA was delivered to JAX Mouse Diversity Genotyping Array Service (Jackson Laboratory) for the SNP Array genotyping.
 E-GEOD-39092 - Colon tissue of Il10-/- mice monoassociated with Escherichia coli NC101 or Escherichia faecalis OG1RF (PAMM-077 array) We observed that interleukin-10 knockout (Il10-/-) mice injected with azoxymethane (AOM) and monoassociated with E. coli NC101, but not E. faecalis OG1RF, develop tumors.     Histologic inflammation is not different in mice monoassociated with either bacterium.     The goal of this experiment is to assess inflammatory cytokine levels in colonic tissue of these mice.     4 germ-free Il10-/- mice were assayed and used as controls.     4 E. coli and 4 E. faecalis monoassociated mice were experimental samples.
 E-GEOD-14481 - identification of TGCT genes involved in initiation and maintenance of transformed germ cells. Initially, we had compared gene expression differences in the embryonic gonads (E13.5) of the 129 and M19 strains by performing microarray analysis.      These studies allowed us to identify downregulation of expression of the D19Bwg1357e, Zfp162 and Cox15 genes in the M19 strain.     We next decided to examine gene expression profile changes in the embryonic gonads of 129 and M19 at additional stages so as to identify other TGCT genes from M19 that are also involved in initiation and maintenance of transformed germ cells.      For this we isolated E13.5, E15.5 and E17.5 genital ridges from male embryos.       Microarray analysis of E13.5, E15.5 and E17.5 genital ridges from male embryos of M19 and 129. Total RNA prepared from the embryonic gonads were analyzed on 12 Affymetrix mouse 430 2 arrays.     The objective of the analysis is to determine the differentially expressed genes for the following comparisons: 1. Comparisons of the two strains at each stage, specifically: 1a. 129-E13-GR vs. M19-E13-GR 1b. 129-E15-GR vs. M19-E15-GR 1c. 129-E17-GR vs. M19-E17-GR 2. Comparisons of the different stage in strain 129, specifically: 2a. 129-E13-GR vs. 129-E15-GR  2b. 129-E15-GR vs. 129-E17-GR 3. Comparisons of the different stage in strain CSS, specifically: 3a. M19-E13-GR vs. M19-E15-GR 3b. M19-E15-GR vs. M19-E17-GR After data process and quality assessment, 38069 out of 45101 probe sets proceeded for further analysis to identify differentially expressed genes.     Hierarchical cluster analysis shows that samples of two strains from the same stage were grouped together and separated from the other stages (Fig.8). The initial analysis indicates a number of trends in gene expression patterns.      Moreover, downregulation of expression of D19Bwg1357e, Zfp162 and Cox15 genes in M19 was also verified in this analysis.      These data are currently being analyzed with the help of Dr. Y. Ji and L. Xiao from the Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology and Department of Biostatistics at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.      The results are unpublished.
 E-GEOD-17962 - Expression data from regulatory T cells with Stat3 ablation We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression dependent upon Stat3 in regulatory T cells Regulatory T cells isolated from Foxp3 Cre/wtS  Stat3 fl/wt  or Foxp3  Cre/wt  Stat3  fl/fl  were isolated using FACS based sorting followed by RNA extraction, amplification, labeling and hybridization on Affymatrix Microarray
 E-GEOD-8009 - NF-kB target genes in dendritic cells The ability of dendritic cells (DC) to initiate immunity and induce antigen-specific tolerance makes DC ideal targets for pharmacological intervention into immune responses.     NF-kB factors are a family of transcriptional regulators important for DC development and function.     However, the identity of NF-kB target genes that are central to DC biology is largely unknown.     In the present study IkBa super repressor (IkBa-SR) and DNA microarray analysis were used to determine the repertoire of NF-kB responsive genes in DC. In DC these genes regulate vital DC functions of antigen uptake and presentation, motility, survival, etc.      Taking in account limitations of the genome-wide microarray analysis, generated transcription factor data were confirmed by the independent means of RT-PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation.     Kinetics of NF-kB induction by well-known DC activatory agents TNFa and LPS were further analysed.     NF-kB regulated genes can be potentially useful targets for the development of more specific anti-inflammatory agents for clinical applications.     Keywords: drug treatment, adenovirus transduction DC were generated in vitro from bone marrow of CAR transgenic mice as described previously (Hieronymus, T., T. C. Gust, R. D. Kirsch, T. Jorgas, G. Blendinger, M. Goncharenko, K. Supplitt, S. Rose-John, A. M. Muller, and M. Zenke.     2005. Progressive and controlled development of mouse dendritic cells from Flt3+CD11b+ progenitors in vitro.     J Immunol 174:2552-2562). Immature DC were transduced with AdIkBa-SR adenovirus, AdOVA control virus, or left untreated.     Cells were then stimulated with TNFa, or left unstimulated.     Total RNA was amplified, labelled and hybridised to Affymetrix MOE430A arrays.     TNFa up- and down-regulated genes, as well as genes regulated by AdOVA control virus, and suppressed by AdIkBa-SR were analysed.
 E-MEXP-454 - Transcription profiling of mouse XX and XY somatic gonadal compartment during sex determination Expression profiles of XX and XY somatic gonadal compartment during sex determination.     This experiment was updated in March 2011 to correct the incorrect age value for sample Female E10.5 6 (was 11 days should be 10.5).
 E-GEOD-74538 - Transcription profiling of midbrain samples from Ezh2 knockout mouse embryos Background:  Precise spatiotemporal control of gene expression is essential for the establishment of correct cell numbers and identities during brain development.     This process involves epigenetic control mechanisms, such as those mediated by the polycomb group protein Ezh2 that catalyzes trimethylation of histone H3K27 (H3K27me3) and thereby represses gene expression.      Results:  Here we show that Ezh2 plays a crucial role in development and maintenance of the midbrain.     Conditional deletion of Ezh2 in the developing midbrain resulted in decreased neural progenitor proliferation, which is associated with derepression of cell cycle inhibitors and negative regulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.     Of note, Ezh2 ablation also promoted ectopic expression of a forebrain transcriptional program involving derepression of the forebrain determinants Foxg1 and Pax6. This was accompanied by reduced expression of midbrain markers, including Pax3 and Pax7, as a consequence of decreased Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.     Conclusion:  Ezh2 is required for appropriate brain growth and for maintenance of regional identity by H3K27me3-mediated gene repression and control of canonical Wnt signaling.      After tissue isolation from dorsal midbrains of embryonic day (E) 10.5 embryos, total RNA was isolated with the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen) and RNase-Free DNase Set (79254, Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions.     Isolated total RNA of E10.5 control (n=3, from 2 different litters) and Ezh2 cko (n=3, from 2 different litters) dorsal midbrains was used for microarray analysis performed at the Functional Genomics Center Zurich (FGCZ), Switzerland, using the Affymetrix A430 platform.
 E-GEOD-6397 - Transcription profiling of mouse heart from Lmna H222P heterozygous and control mice The present research is devoted to the identification of gene(s) severely affected by LMNA mutations, leading to striated muscle laminopathies and more specifically the cardiomyopathy.     For this purpose, we developped a large-scale gene expression approach on heart and skeletal tissues from Lmna H222P heterozygous Knock-In mouse model.     Experiment Overall Design: In the project presented here we performed differential expression in heart from a mouse model of EDMD: a LmnaH222P knock-in mouse created via homologous recombination by Gisele Bonne in Paris, France (Arimura et al., 2005). The mutant male LmnaH222P knock-in homozygous mice display reduced locomotion activity with abnormal stiff walking posture and all of them die by 9 months of age.     As for cardiac phenotype, they develop chamber dilation and hypokinesia with conduction defects.     These results demonstrate that LmnaH222P knock-in homozygous mice represents a good model for studying laminopathies affecting striated muscles as they develop a dystrophic condition of both skeletal and cardiac muscles reminiscent of the human diseases.     Genes were identified as differentially expressed if they met a false discovery rate threshold of 0.05 in a two-sample t-test (q-value) and showed at least a two-fold difference in expression independent of absolute signal intensity.
 E-MEXP-2796 - Transcription profiling by array of mouse spleen after treatment with egg ovomucoid in sensitised mice compared with un-sensitised controls Thirty female BALB/c mice of 6-8 weeks of age were purchased from Charles River (Montreal, QC, Canada) and divided randomly into control (n=15) and treated (n=15) groups.     Mice were maintained on an egg free diet in the pathogen-free conditions at the University of Guelph Central Animal Facility.     Animals were maintained between 2224°C and at a relative humidity of 4050%. The light-to-dark cycle was maintained at 12 h from 7 AM to 7 PM.  All of the animal experiments were approved by the University of Guelph Animal Care Committee according the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC) guidelines.Mice were exposed to intra-gastric gavage (i.g.) twice every week for 5 weeks with OVM (1 mg/100 μl) and 10 μg of cholera toxin adjuvant.     An amino acid (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) solution of 10 μg/μl (100 μl per mouse with 10 μg of cholera toxin) was used as a negative control.     The amino acids were mixed accordingly to match the OVM amino acid composition.     Five weeks after the first sensitization, mice were challenged by i.p. injection with 1 mg of OVM in 50 μl of sterile water and aluminum hydroxide (50 μl, 2% Alhydrogel) adjuvant (Superfos Biosector, Denmark), to induce an immediate type-1 hypersensitivity reaction.     The anaphylactic responses were visualized and scored depending on the response of the individual mice in each of the treated and control groups.     After 40 min, mice were euthanized with CO2 and partial spleen tissue samples were collected in RNAlater solution for microarray experiment (Ambion Inc., TX, USA). Spleen samples in RNAlater solution were kept at 4oC overnight prior to long term storage at -80oC.
 E-GEOD-17229 - Mouse Cells Time of Replication (ToR) Measurment of the ToR by comapring the DNA content of the S phase and the DNA content of the G1 phase, the method is based on the method used in the paper - Replication timing of the human genome by Woodfine et al. that was published in Hum. Mol. Genet.     2004. Briefly, after staining with Propidium Iodide,  cells in G1 and S phase of the cell cycle are sorted by FACS sorter (ARIA or Vantage), DNA is then extracted from the fractions and differentially labeled with dUTP-Cy3 or dUTP-Cy5 using direct labeling (Agilent labeling kit). The labeled DNA is cohybridized to the array.     Early replicating sequences correspond to the spots with high S/G1 ratio and late replicating sequences correspond to the spots with low S/G1 ratio.     two mouse tissues were measured (MEF and L1210), 2 replicates for each sample
 E-GEOD-19402 - Gene expression data from hippocampus, striatum, hypothalamus cortex, Drd2-MSNs and Drd1-MSNs in mice Goal of the experiment: Analysis of gene expression changes in the cortex, striatum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, Drd2-MSNs and Drd1-MSNs of mice with a postnatal, neuron-specific ablation of GLP or G9a as compared to control mice.     For microarray analysis, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cortex and striatum of Camk2a-Cre; GLPfl/fl, Camk2a-Cre; G9afl/fl and age (10-14 week old) and sex matched littermate controls were used for total RNA purification.     Four biological replicates were performed for each experiment.     Polyribosome associated mRNAs from five, age (10-14 week old) and sex matched Drd1-Cre; Drd1-bacTRAP; G9afl/fl, or Drd2-Cre; Drd2-bacTRAP; G9afl/fl and Drd1-bacTRAP; G9afl/fl or Drd2-bacTRAP; G9afl/fl control mice were used.     Three biological replicates were performed for each experiment.
 E-GEOD-62805 - Hepatic gene expression in C56BL/6J mice fed a quercetin diet for 20 weeks Both the 0.05% and 1% querceitn diets did not significantly affect the body weight, fat accumulation, and blood components.     However, 0.05% quercetin significantly increased the glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratio in the liver.     Moreover, the 1% quercetin diet reduced the lipid peroxidation markers 8-isoprostane in plasma and malondialdehyde in the liver, epididymal adipose tissues, and small intestine.     Although comprehensive gene expression analysis dot not detect the genes with significantly different expression levels among the groups of mice, RT-PCR analysis showed that the 1% quercetin diet significantly induced the expression of the antioxidant enzymes Gpx1, Cat, and Sod1 in the liver and Gpx1 and Cat in the epididymal adipose tissues.     The transcription factor nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was slightly induced in the nuclear fraction of the livers of mice fed the 1% quercetin diet.     Quercetin may induce antioxidant enzymes by directly or indirectly activating the Nrf2 pathway in the liver.     Five-week-old male mice were fed a AIN-93G diet containing 0% (Control), 0.05% (0.05% quercetin diet), or 1% quercertin  (1% quercetin diet) for 20 weeks.
 E-GEOD-11796 - Transcription profiling of human wild type and mutant hepatoma cells botg ligand-activated and -unactivated AHR Starting with our early global expression analyses of TCDD-treated human hepatoma cells {Puga, 2000 4679 /id}, the AHR transcriptional induction profile has been extensively studied, whether activated by TCDD, B[a]P or in the absence of exogenous ligands (reviewed in {Frericks, 2007 5618 /id}).  In addition to using prior knowledge to integrate expression profiles into the AHR gene target network, we performed a new set of expression profile analyses of wild type Hepa-1c1c7 and c35 cell lines and compared the responses in naïve cells with responses in TCDD or B[a]P exposed cells for 8 hours.      Results of our expression array studies are in close agreement with current knowledge.     Experiment Overall Design: Three biological replicates were each performed for wildype naïve cells  (DMSO), TCDD activated cells, and B[a]P activated cells, and for c35 (AHR mutant) naïve cells (DMSO), TCDD activated cells, and B[a]P activated cells.
 E-GEOD-8000 - Transcription profiling of mouse heart samples from individuals with homozygous or heterozygous mutant alleles of Lamin A (LMNA) This SuperSeries is composed of the following subset Series:; GSE6397: Comparison between gene expression in heart from Lmna H222P heterozygous and control mice; GSE6398: Comparison between gene expression in heart from Lmna H222P homozygous and control mice Experiment Overall Design: Refer to individual Series
 E-GEOD-10552 - Genome wide expression analysis in AtT-20 cells following Dnmt1 knockdown Efficient and sustained knockdown of DNMT1 transcript and protein was achieved using a consecutive transfection protocol in the mouse pituitary adenoma cell line, AtT-20.  Genome wide microarray analysis identified 91 transcripts that were significantly differentially expressed relative to cells treated with a non-targeting control.     Keywords: Differential expression AtT-20 cells were repeatedly treated with 20 nM siRNA (siDNMT1 or siNT) over an eight day period.      After eight days total RNA was extracted and prepared for microarray analysis.      The procedure was repeated three times independently.
 E-MTAB-1691 - Transcription profiling by array of lens fiber cells from transgenic mouse line alphaA-CLEF which mimics the activation of canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling against cells from wild-type controls to study catarat formation Transgenic mouse line called alphaA-CLEF in which transactivation domain of beta-catenin is fused to the amino terminus of DNA-binding protein LEF and the expression of transgenic protein is controlled by alphaA-crystallin promoter (-342/+49)  was used to mimic the activation of canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in lens fiber cells.     The aim of this experiment was to compare the mRNA expression in wild type and transgenic (CLEF) P1-P3 lenses and reveal the differentially expressed genes.
 E-GEOD-54678 - A pivotal role of SRC-2 in Metastatic and Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer SRC-2 is frequently amplified or overexpressed in metastatic prostate cancer patients.     In this study, we used genetically engineered mice, overexpressing SRC-2 specifically in the prostate epithelium as a mouse model to examine the role of SRC-2 in prostate tumorigenesis.     Over-expression of SRC-2 in PTEN heterozygous mice accelerates PTEN mutation induced tumor progression and develops a metastasis-prone cancer.     We used microarrays to examine the molecular profile of prostate-specific SRC-2 overexpression adult dorsal-lateral prostate in comparison with that of control PTENF/+ heterozygous deletion mice.     Total RNA was extracted from dorsal-lateral prostate of 7 months old-PTEN flox/+ control and PTEN flox/+; Rosa26-SRC-2 OE/+ adult mice, followed by gene expression profiling using Affymetrix microarrays.     Each sample contains pooled prostate RNA from 3 mice.
 E-GEOD-11253 - Transcription profiling of mouse Rb, p130 and p107 deficient hematopoietic stem Cells Loss of Rb family in HSCs results in a severe phenotype, such as enhanced proliferation and increase in stem cell number.     In addition, HSCs were higly mobilized but failed to transplant.     Rb family deficient mice rapidly exhibit a myeloproliferative disease with eosinophilic characteristics.     Meanwhile, the lymphoid compartment was severely decreased, due to high apoptotic activity in this lineage.     Experiment Overall Design: We used mice that harbor floxed alleles for the Rb family and we induced the recombination by 6 weeks of age.     KLS (c-Kit+ Lin - Sca-1+) cells were sorted 2 months after the recombination.     Experiment Overall Design: Total of 6 hybridizations done.      One Sample was excluded from our analysis based on high background and anomalous control probeset values.
 E-GEOD-13192 - Liver X receptor beta is the dominant LXR subtype in skeletal muscle Liver X receptors (LXRs) are important regulators of cholesterol, lipid and glucose metabolism and have been extensively studied in liver, macrophages and adipose tissue.     However, their role in skeletal muscle is not yet fully elucidated and the functional role of each of the LXRα and LXRβ subtypes in skeletal muscle is at present unknown.     To study the importance of each of the receptor subtypes, myotube cultures derived from wild type (WT), LXRα and LXRβ knockout (KO) mice were established.     The present study shows that treatment with the unselective LXR agonist T0901317 increased mRNA levels of LXR target genes such as sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1), fatty acid synthase (FASN), stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) in myotubes established from WT and LXRα KO mice.     However, only minor changes in expression level were observed for these genes after treatment with T0901317 in myotubes from LXRβ KO mice.     Gene expression analysis using Affymetrix NuGO Genechip arrays showed that few other genes than the classical, well known LXR target genes were regulated by LXR in skeletal muscle.     Furthermore, functional studies using radiolabeled substrates showed that treatment with T0901317 increased lipogenesis and apoA1 dependent cholesterol efflux, in myotubes from WT and LXRα KO mice, but not LXRβ KO mice.     The data suggest that the lipogenic effects of LXRs, as well as the LXR-stimulated cholesterol efflux, are mainly mediated by LXRβ in skeletal muscle.     To study the importance of each of the receptor subtypes, myotube cultures derived from wild type (WT), LXRa and LXRb knockout (KO) mice were established.     Sixteen samples were examined.     Half the samples were treated with the unselective LXR agonist T0901317.
 E-GEOD-62732 - Gene Expression Profiling of Fibroblasts in Actute Kidney Injury Fibroblasts are present in every organ.     While the role fibroblasts in chronic diseases such as fibrosis or tumor expression has been extensively explored, little is known about their physiological role.     The kidney possesses a unique capacity to recover from even severe acute injury.     We study molecular mechanisms of this intrinsic repair capacity in the mouse model of ischemia-reperfusion (IR). In this model, the renal artery and vein are clamped for 45 min, leading to acute kidney injury.     The kidney spontaneously recovers from such IR injury within 14 days.     IR kidney injury is associated with a transient accumulation of fibroblasts in the diseased tissue.     We hypothesized that fibroblasts aid the repair of acute IR injury in the kidney.     To elucidate how FSP1+ fibroblasts may contribute to the repair of kidney injury, we undertook a global unbiased approach to compare gene expression profiles of fibroblasts isolated from kidneys post-IRI and from control kidneys by FACS sorting.     To investigate the role fibroblasts may play in the repair of kidney inhury, we performed ischemia reperfusion injury surgery on transgenic mice in which the FSP-1 promoter drives EGFP expression.     Kidney injury peaks at day 3 post-IRI, followed by spontaneous regeration that restores nearly perfect kidney architecture and health by day 10. Fibroblasts are thought to possibly play a role in this process, as they are normally rare in the healthy kidney, acute kidney injury is associated with a transient accumulation of interstitial fibroblasts, but whether they may help repair the acute kidney injury or in fact could contribute to the damage is not known.     To compare the  gene expression profiles of normal fibroblasts and those from post-ischemic kidneys, we sacrificed control FSP1-GFP mice and the FSP1-GFP mice three days post-IRI. We generated single-cell suspensions from both the post-IRI and control kidneys, and then isolated FSP1-GFP+ cells by FACS sorting that, when cultured on plastic, displayed typical fibroblast morphology.      Total RNA was immediately extracted from the sorted cells and amplified to produce enough for a array.     We biotinylated five of the samples from post-ischemic kidneys and three of the control (non-ischemic) kidneys and used Affymetrix 3' Arrays to examine differences in gene expression profiles between the two groups that may she some light on what role, if any, fibroblasts play in the spontaneous healing of the kidney after acute kidney injury.     We performed ischemia reperfusion surgery in FSP1-GFP mice, and at day 3, we sacrificed the mice, isolated FSP1-GFP positive cells from both IR and normal control kidneys by FACS sorting, extracted total RNA from the isolated FSP1-GFP cells and used Affymetrix Mouse Expression Array 430 2.0 microarrays to perform gene expression profiling of the samples.     All told, we performed the FACS Sorting, RNA extration, and hybridization with 5 ischemic kidneys and 3 normal kidneys.     Fibroblasts, acute kidney injury, repair, comparative gene expression profiling, microarrays, FACS sorting, role in healing
 E-GEOD-23421 - Transcription profiling by array of colon tissues from PPAR-gamma deficient mice and wild-type littermates to study the effect of PPAR-gamma on dextran sodium sulphate induced colitis Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a condition characterized by severe intestinal inflammation and immune cell activation.      The severity of the disease can be mitigated by compounds which activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma), a receptor present widely in tissues involved in IBD pathogenesis.      Our objective was to assess the affect of macrophage-specific deficiency of PPAR gamma on peripheral and colonic immune populations and colonic gene expression in experimental IBD.  Macrophage-specific PPAR gamma-deficient mice (PPAR gamma flfl Lysozyme M Cre+) and control (PPAR gamma flfl Lysozyme M Cre-) littermates were treated with 2.5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) for 7 days.      Disease activity was recorded daily and immune cell populations in the blood, spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), and lamina propria were examined by flow cytometry.      Colonic gene expression was assessed by real time PCR and microarray analyses.      Our findings show that macrophage PPAR r-deficiency significantly exacerbates DSS inflammation.       CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (T-regs) were significantly reduced in Cre+ mice, and MLN macrophages and CD40 expression were enhanced.      There were significant differences in the number colonic macrophages between Cre+ and Cre- mice, but those from Cre+ mice expressed more CD40, Ly6C, and TLR-4.  PPAR r-deficiency also increased the percent of CD8+ T cells in the lamina propria and enhanced colonic interferon gamma expression.      Our findings indicate that macrophage PPAR gamma deficiency augments the severity of DSS colitis by reducing peripheral T-regs and increasing colonic macrophage activation and T cell inflammation.     RNA from 3 PPAR gamma-deficient mice (PPAR gamma flfl; Lysozyme M Cre+) and 3 control (PPAR gamma flfl; Lysozyme M Cre-) littermates was processed and labeled according to the standard target labeling protocols.     The samples were hybridized, stained, and scanned per standard Affymetrix protocols at the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute (VBI) core laboratory on Mouse 430 2.0 expression arrays (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA).
 E-GEOD-10806 - Transcription profiling of mouse iPS cells from neural stem cells by 2 factors (Oct4, KLF4) (Kim, Zaehres et al.) Reprogramming of somatic cells is a valuable tool to understand the mechanisms of regaining pluripotency and further opens up the possibility to generate patient-specific pluripotent stem cells.     Reprogramming of mouse and human somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells, designated as induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, has been possible with the expression of the transcription factor quartet Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4. Considering that ectopic expression of  c-Myc causes tumourigenicity in offspring and retroviruses themselves can cause insertional mutagenesis, the generation of iPS cells with a minimal number of factors may hasten the clinical application of this approach.     Here, we show that adult mouse neural stem cells (NSCs) express higher endogenous levels of Sox2 and c-Myc than ES cells and that exogenous Oct4 together with either Klf4 or c-Myc are sufficient to generate iPS cells from NSCs. These two-factor (2F) iPS cells are similar to embryonic stem cells at the molecular level, contribute to development of the germline, and form chimeras.     We propose that, in inducing pluripotency, the number of reprogramming factors can be reduced when using somatic cells that endogenously express appropriate levels of complementing factors.     Experiment Overall Design: 8 hybridizations in total.

 E-GEOD-21393 - Stroke-brain infiltrating stem cells - mouse Genes upregulated in stroke infiltrating stem cells were compared against the parent non-infiltrated mouse stem cell line derived from immortomouseTM. Abstract Background and Purpose- Although the therapeutic potential of bone marrow-derived stem cells (SC) has been addressed in different experimental models of ischemic stroke, it is still unclear how SC induce neuroprotection following stroke.     In this study, we describe a novel method for recovering SC infiltrating post-stroke brain tissue allowing the determination of  genes which become persistently activated / or depressed (compared to their naïve counterparts) during SC-mediated neuroprotection.     Methods- Ischemic stroke was induced in C57BL/6 mice by middle cerebral artery occlusion for 1 h, followed by reperfusion.     SC were isolated from H-2Kb-tsA58 (immortomouseTM) mice, and were administered (i.v.) 24 h after reperfusion.     At the onset of therapeutic improvement (14 days after ischemia), infarcted brain tissue was isolated and infarct-infiltratng SC cultured at 33°C. Microarray analysis and RT-PCR were performed to compare persistent differential gene expression between naïve  and infiltrating SC populations.     Results- Z-scoring revealed dramatic changes in extracellular genes of analyzed cells.     Pair-wise analysis detected 80 extracellular factor genes that were up-regulated (  2 fold, P 0.05, Benjamini-Hochberg correction) between naïve and infiltrated SC. Although several conventional neuroregenerative, nerve guidance and angiogenic factors (bFGF, bone morphogenetic protein, angiopoietins, neural growth factors were among the expressed genes detected  we identified Cytokine receptor-like factor 1 (Crlf1), Fgf7, family with sequence similarity 19, member A5 (Fam19a5), Glypican 1 (Gpc1), Dickkopf homolog 2 (Dkk2), Endothelial cell-specific molecule 1, Osteopontin (OPN)35, Tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2, Masp3 mRNA for MBL-associated serine protease-3, Glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor (Gdnf), Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (Bmp2), Olfactomedin 1, Sushi-repeat-containing protein, X-linked 2 (Srpx2). Conclusions- SC infiltrating the post-i  schemic brain assume a persistently altered pattern of expressed extracellular genes compared to naïve SC that contributes to neuroprotection, regeneration and angiogenesis in infarcts.      Keywords: Gene activation / suppression study Comparison of persistent stem cell gene expression induced by stroke-infarct infiltration
 E-GEOD-13526 - Transcription profiling of mouse WT and Nxf2 KO post-natal day 21 testes In euakryotes, mRNAs must be exported from the nucleus to the cytsoplasm.     NXF2 is highly expressed in the mouse male germ cells.      We are interested in its function in spermatogenesis, espically in the nuclear RNA export in the testis.     To this end, we made Nxf2 mutant mice by gene targeting.     In an attempt to identify the mRNA substrates of NXF2, we perform the microarray experiments on testes.     We used microarrays to check the expression profiles of the Nxf2 WT and KO 21d testes on C57BL/6 background.     Experiment Overall Design: To examine the expression difference between WT and Nxf2 KO testes, we collected testes from juvenile mice of three ages ( 21d, 26d, 28d). Testis weight was similar between WT and KO mice at post-natal day 21.  Three pairs of WT and KO 21d testes were chosen for microarray analysis.
 E-GEOD-24637 - Genetic and genomic analysis of hyperlipidemia, obesity and diabetes using TALLYHO x C57BL6 F2 mice Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is the most common form of diabetes in humans and is closely associated with dyslipidemia and obesity that magnifies the mortality and morbidity related to T2D. The TALLYHO/JngJ (TH) mouse is a polygenic model for T2D characterized by obesity, hyperinsulinemia, impaired glucose uptake and tolerance, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia.     To determine the genetic factors that contribute to these T2D related characteristics in TH mice, we interbred TH mice with C57BL/6J (B6) mice.     The parental, F1, and F2 mice were phenotyped at 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 weeks of age for 4-hour fasting plasma triglyceride, cholesterol, insulin, and glucose levels, as well as body weights.     Fat pad and carcass weights were measured at 24 weeks after sacrificing the mice.     The F2 mice were genotyped genome-wide for 68 markers.     Of 393 genotyped F2 mice, 16 were chosen from the extremes of the triglyceride distribution (8 high and 8 low), and liver, pancreas, muscle and adipose tissue were measured for gene expression.     Gene expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis aided in selection of candidates underlying hyperlipidemia, diabetes and obesity QTLs. We identified several genetic loci that affected quantitative variation in plasma lipid and glucose levels and obesity traits.     16 (8 high and 8 low) out of 393 F2 mice were chosen from the extremes of the triglyceride distribution, excluding overtly diabetic mice, and liver, pancreas, muscle and adipose tissue were measured for gene expression.     In addition to data from the 64 microarrays on the 16 mice, a supplemental file with phenotypes and marker genotypes is provided for all mice as a supplementary file on the Series record (below). Mouse identification numbers are included to connect the data files.
 E-GEOD-44308 - Sox11 loss-of-function mutant cortex at E17.5 Expression profiling of cortex from embryonic day (E) 17.5 telencephalon of Sox11(+/+) and Sox11(-/-) mouse embryos.     Sox11 is implicated in regulating proliferation, neuronal migration and differentiation.     We used microarray to identify genes that were differentially expressed in the cortex in the wild type and Sox11 knockout embryos at E17.5. To uncover the molecular mechanisms undelying the function of Sox11 in cortical development, we conducted microarray analysis of E17.5 cortices from wild type and Sox11(-/-) mice.     Total RNA was isolated from the cortex of one wild type embryo and one Sox11(-/-) littermate at E17.5. cRNA probe synthesis, hybridization, scanning, and data collection were performed following the manufacturer's instruction.
 E-GEOD-13807 - Identification and validation of gene expression changes upon removal of Dicer in the murine limb mesenchyme Wild type and Dicer null embryonic mouse limbs were analaysed using Affymetrix arrays to identify gene expression changes.     Genes that were up-regulated in Dicer-null limbs were canidates for being miRNA targets.     Potential miRNA target genes were validated using qRTPCR. Mice carrying a heterozygous Dicer floxed allele and the prxcre driver allele were crossed to homozygous Dicer Floxed mice.     Embryos were harvested from pregent moms and genotyped to determine heterozygous, Wild type and mutant limb buds.     These limb buds were used to prepare RNA for array analysis.
 E-GEOD-17796 - Expression data from B6C3F1 mice treated with reduced oxygen Mice received decreasing oxygen concentrations from 21% to 6% O2 for ~ 30 minutes.     Then, the mice remained an additional 120 minutes at 6% O2, control mice were placed insimilarchambers but recieved normal (21%) oxygen.     Mice were euthanased by cervical dislocation under ketamine / acepromazine (100 mg/kg / 5 mg/kg, I.P) anesthesia.     The bone marrow from the right humerus, a portion of the left lateral liver lobe and half a cross-section of the spleen were harvested and the RNA was isolated from these tissues using standard Qiagen reagents.     Standard Affymetrix protocols were used for GeneChip probe preparations.     39 arrays.
 E-GEOD-36665 - Gene expression profiling of Wwox targeted ablation in mouse mammary epithelial cells The WWOX gene has been implicated in human cancers, including breast cancer.The development and tumorigenesis between human and mouse mammary glands (MGs) share similar molecular details and signal transduction pathways.     We established mouse line that specifically knockout the expression of WWOX gene in the MG epithelial cells (MECs) by crossing BK5-cre mice with our WWOX flox stain.     In order to study the gene expression profile in the subpopulation MECs, we isolated the organoids from the 4th MGs of both BK5-cre +; WWOX flox/flox (KO) mice and their WT counterparts (BK5-cre -; WWOX flox/flox), 3 mice each genotype.     The total RNA from the mouse MG organoids was extracted and purified by TRIzol/RNeasy Kit and their integrity was checked on Agilent RNA 6000 Nanochip.     The goal is to identify the significant perturbation in tumorigenic pathways in these cells induced by WWOX ablation.     Mammary gland epithelial organoids samples and gene expression profiles were deribed from three WWOX-KO mice (BK5-cre +; WWOX flox/flox) and from three WWOX-WT mice (BK5-cre -; WWOX flox/flox)
 E-GEOD-5127 - Transcription profiling of mouse lung treated with carcinogens and controls to evaluate carcinogenicity and identify biomarkers Two-year rodent bioassays play a central role in evaluating both the carcinogenic potential of a chemical and generating quantitative information on the dose-response behavior for chemical risk assessments.     The bioassays involved are expensive and time-consuming, requiring nearly lifetime exposures (two years) in mice and rats and costing $2 to $4 million per chemical.     Since there are approximately 80,000 chemicals registered for commercial use in the United States and 2,000 more are added each year, applying animal bioassays to all chemicals of concern is clearly impossible.     To efficiently and economically identify carcinogens prior to widespread use and human exposure, alternatives to the two-year rodent bioassay must be developed.     In this study, animals were exposed for 13 weeks to two chemicals that were positive for lung tumors in the two-year rodent bioassay, two chemicals that were negative for tumors, and two vehicle controls.      Gene expression analysis was performed on the lungs of the animals to assess the potential for identifying gene expression biomarkers that can predict tumor formation in a two-year bioassay following a 13 week exposure.     Experiment Overall Design: Five week old female B6C3F1 mice were exposed for 13 weeks to the following treatments: 1) 1,5-Naphthalenediamine, CAS No. 2243-62-1, feed, 2000 ppm, positive lung carcinogen; 2) 2,3-Benzofuran, CAS No. 271-89-6, gavage, 240 mg/kg, positive lung carcinogen; 3) N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride, CAS No. 1465-25-4, feed, 2000 ppm, negative lung carcinogen; 4) Pentachloronitrobenzene, CAS No. 82-68-8, feed, 8187 ppm, negative lung carcinogen; 5) Feed control; 6) Corn oil gavage control.      Feed animals were exposed 7 days/week and gavage animals were exposed 5 days/week (5 ml/kg).  Microarray analysis was performed on the lungs of three mice per treatment group.
 E-GEOD-81675 - Gene expression in Src-/- RAW264.7 cells infected with VSV and HSV-1 The purpose of this study was to determine what are the effects of Src deficiency on innate antiviral response upon virus infection in RAW264.7 cells.     Wild type and Src-/- RAW264.7 cells were infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) for 6h. Then the differentially regulated genes were analyzed.     Wild type and Src-/- RAW264.7 cells were infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, MOI=1) or herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1, MOI=5) for 6h. Equal amounts of RNA were assayed for gene expression using Affymetrix mouse 430 2.0 arrays.
 E-GEOD-69935 - Modeling the time resolved transcriptional signature of time sequential stimulation with HGF and IL-6 in hepatocyte proliferation Liver regeneration is characterized by a scheduled sequence of inner and intra-cellular signaling events.     It starts with an initial inflammatory phase, followed by a period of rapidly proliferating hepatocytes and stopping abruptly when the liver mass is restored.     The cytokines hepatocellular growth factor (HGF) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) play a pivotal role during this process with the former driving proliferation that is enhanced by the latter.     While the individual importance of HGF and IL6 has been studied comprahensively the role of cross-talk in control of hepatic proliferation is jet largely unknown.     To this end, we performed time-resolved transcriptional profiling of of murine hepatocytes stimulated with HGF and IL-6 indiviually as well as in combination.     Thorough systematic investigation performing statistical analysis, mathematical formalization of cross-talk effects on the transcriptional level as well as gene-regulatory network inference revealed the transcriptional program of the cross-talk initiated by HGF and IL-6. Using the proliferation associated Hepcidin (Hamp) and Amphiregulin (Areg) as marker genes for liver regeneration we perform exthensive in-silico experiments with the inferred gene-regulatory network for the identification of the most important players in regulation of the proliferation process.     Among other genes, this predicted chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (Cxcl10) as an important factor in the temporal regulation of proliferation.     These predictions were validated by independent in vitro expression data as well as independent in vivo literature data.     While Cxcl10 is known to be involved in liver regeneration, our study extend its role towards its temporal orchestration.     Cells were stimulated with either 40 ng/ml rmHGF (all R&D Systems) and 40 ng/ml rhIL-6 alone or in combination.     Cells were left untreated as unstimulated control.     RNA was extracted at 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,24 hours.     Cells were treated with IL6 alone for the first 4 hours and then additionally with HGF from hours 4-24. Controls were taken at -5,0,4,8,12,24 hours.
 E-MEXP-923 - Transcription profiling by array of esophageal epithelial tissue from mice with transgenic expression of Klf5 Three mice with transgenic expression of the transcription factor Klf5 in esophageal epithelia were compared with three littermate controls at 3 months of age
 E-GEOD-59865 - Cell type-specific requirements for iPSC reprogramming The differentiated state of somatic cells provides barriers for the efficient derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). To address why some cell types reprogram more readily than others, we studied the effect of combined modulation of cellular signaling pathways.     This revealed that inhibition of TGFβ together with activation of Wnt signaling in presence of ascorbic acid allows  80% of murine fibroblasts to acquire pluripotency after one week of reprogramming factor expression.     In contrast, hepatic progenitors and blood progenitors predominantly required only TGFβ inhibition or canonical Wnt activation, respectively, to reprogram at efficiencies approaching 100%. Strikingly, blood progenitors reactivated endogenous pluripotency loci in a highly synchronous manner.     We further demonstrate that expression of specific chromatin-modifying enzymes and reduced TGFβ/MAP kinase activity are intrinsic properties associated with the unique reprogramming response of these cells.      Together, our observations define novel cell type-specific requirements for the rapid and synchronous reprogramming of somatic cells.     For the study of reprogramming intermediates, cultures of reprogrammable MEFs at day 4 in presence of dox and compounds were harvested and stained with biotinylated anti-SSEA1 antibody (MC-480, eBioscience), followed by APC-conjugated Streptavidin and then anti-APC microbeads (Milteny Biotec) and enrichment using MACS separation columns (Milteny Biotec) according to manufacturer’s instructions.     Total RNA extracted from SSEA1+ cells ( 90% purity) with the RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN) with a RIN value   8 was subjected to transcriptional analyses with Affymetrix mouse genome 430 2.0 mRNA expression microarrays followed by bioinformatic analyses.
 E-GEOD-34388 - Transcriptional Alterations in Skeletal Muscle Following Desmin Deletion Desmin is a cytoskeletal protein in muscle involved in integrating cellular space and transmitting forces.      In this study we sought to determine the effects of desmin deletion on skeletal muscle at the transcriptional level across many pathways of muscle physiology.     RNA was isolated from the TA muscle of mice of two genotypes (wildtype (WT) and desmin knockout (KO)) and two ages (7-9 weeks (Adult) and 12-14 months (Aged)).  Numbers per group are as follows: WT Adult (5), WT Aged (5), KO Adult (5), KO Aged (4).
 E-GEOD-74659 - SCL and LMO1 reprogram thymocytes into self-renewing cells. The SCL and LMO1 oncogenic transcription factors reprogram thymocytes into self-renewing pre-leukemic stem cells (pre-LSCs). Here we report that SCL directly interacts with LMO1 to activate the transcription of a self-renewal program coordinated by LYL1. Gene expression profiles of thymocytes from SCL-LMO1 transgenic and age-matched non transgenic Cd3ε-/- mice were compared to identify candidate genes that confer self-renewal capability to pre-leukemic thymocytes.
 E-MEXP-153 - Transcription profiling of prop-1 and Ghrhr mutations in gene expression during normal aging in mice (Ames dwarf and Little mice) Effects of the prop-1 and Ghrhr mutations in gene expression during normal aging in mice.
 E-GEOD-21155 - Accelerated leukemogenesis by truncated CBFb-SMMHC defective in high-affinity binding with RUNX1 Dominant RUNX1 inhibition has been proposed as a common pathway for CBF-leukemia.      CBFb-SMMHC, a fusion protein in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), dominantly inhibits RUNX1 largely through its RUNX1 high-affinity binding domain (HABD). We generated knock-in mice expressing CBFb-SMMHC with a HABD deletion, CBFb-SMMHCd179-221. These mice developed leukemia highly efficiently, even though hematopoietic defects associated with Runx1-inhibition were partially rescued.     To identify changes in gene expression with the deletion of the HABD, we compared the gene expression profile in leukemia samples from mice expressing CBFb-SMMHCd179-221 with those from mice expressing full length CBFb-SMMHC. Spleen cells were isolated from leukemic knock-in mice with full length CBFb-SMMHC at 2 months after ENU treatment and 2 leukemic CBFb-SMMHCd179-221 expressing chimeric mice at 3 weeks after birth.     For each genotype, we performed two independent experiments with 4 Affymetrix GeneChip 430 chips.
 E-MEXP-703 - Transcription profiling by array of mouse skeletal muscle expressing CnAa or CnAb1 under the control of the MLC promoter after treatment with cardiotoxin The aim of the experiment is to compare the effect of two different calcineurin A isoforms on skeletal muscle in uninjured mice and during skeletal muscle regeneration (after cardiotoxin injection). The transgenic mice express CnAbeta1 or CnAalpha under the control of the myosin light chain promoter and enhancer.
 E-GEOD-68843 - Transcriptom analysis of FLT1 regulated genes in metastasis associated macrophages Gene expression changes in metastasis associated macrophage (MAM) with control and FLT1 inhibitory antibody (MF1) were compared using FACS sorted cells from mice bearing pulmonary metastasis of breast tumor cells treated with Ctrl and MF1 antibody A six chip study using total RNA recovered from metastasis associated macrophages from three separate mice treated with FLT1 inhibitory antibody (MF1) and three separate mice treated with control antibody.      Each chip measures the expression level of 42586 genes.
 E-GEOD-4518 - Transcription profiling of mouse expressing non-cleavable transmembrane mutant form of murine TNFalpha, or treated with soluble TNFalpha (20ng/ml) for 4 hours to investigate divergent and convergent effects on gene expression and function in acute versus chronic endothelial activation Activation of the vascular endothelium with cytokines such as TNF is widely used to study the role of the vasculature in proinflammatory disease.     To gain insight into mechanisms of prolonged vascular endothelial activation we compared changes in gene expression induced by continuous activation in stable tmTNFalpha expressing cells with changes due to acute TNFalpha challenge in vitro.     Affymetrix Genechip® analysis was performed on RNA from control, acute and continuous TNFalpha-activated endothelial cells.     Only 36% of the significant changes in gene expression were convergent between the acute and continuously activated endothelial cells in comparison to the control.      From the divergently regulated genes, for example the cytokine ENA-78 was specifically induced in chronically activated cells, while E-Selectin, a cell adhesion molecule, was upregulated only in acutely activated endothelial cells.     Antioxidant SOD gene induction was noted in acute activation while NADPH oxidase was selectively upregulated in continuous activated endothelium in accordance with significant ROS induction occurred only in these cells.     In addition, the anti-angiogenic genes PAI-1 and thrombospondin were upregulated only in acutely activated endothelium, consistent with reduced angiogenic activity observed in acute versus chronically activated endothelial cells in vitro.     These data suggest that continuous activation of endothelial cells leads to specific expression and functional changes, consistent with alterations observed in dysfunctional endothelium exposed to or involved in chronic inflammation.     Experiment Overall Design: This experiment compares the response of endothelial cells from newborn mice that were either stably transfected with a non-cleavable transmembrane mutant form of murine TNFalpha, or treated with soluble TNFalpha (20ng/ml) for 4 hours.      Each treatment was compared to mock-transfected control cells.     Four replicates for each condition were used.      Five micrograms of total RNA was assayed per Genechip using standard Affymetrix protocols.
 E-GEOD-42264 - Hsp70 and a Novel Axis of Type 1 Interferon-Dependent Antiviral Immunity in the Measles Virus-Infected Brain The major inducible 70 kDa heat shock protein (hsp70) is host protective in a mouse model of measles virus (MeV) brain infection.     Transgenic constitutive expression of hsp70 in neurons, the primary target of MeV infection, abrogates neurovirulence in neonatal H-2d congenic C57BL/6 mice.     A significant level of protection is retained after depletion of T lymphocytes, implicating innate immune mechanisms.     Focus of the present work was to elucidate the basis for hsp70-dependent innate immunity using this model.     Transcriptome analysis of brains from transgenic (TG) and non-transgenic (NT) mice 5 days after infection identified type 1 interferon (IFN) signaling and macrophage activation/antigen presentation as the main differences linked to survival.     The pivotal role for type 1 IFN in hsp70-mediated protection was demonstrated in mice with a genetically disrupted type 1 IFN receptor (IFNAR-/-), where IFNAR-/- eliminated the difference in survival between TG and NT mice.     Brain macrophages, not neurons, are the predominant source of type 1 IFN in the virus-infected brain, and in vitro studies provided a mechanistic basis by which MeV-infected neurons can induce IFN-β in uninfected microglia in an hsp70-dependent manner.     MeV infection induced extracellular release of hsp70 from mouse neuronal cells that constitutively express hsp70, and extracellular hsp70 induced IFN-β transcription in mouse microglial cells through Toll-like receptors 2 and 4. Collectively, results support a novel axis of type 1 IFN-dependent antiviral immunity in the virus-infected brain that is driven by hsp70. Hsp70 expression in mice enhances gene expression related to antiviral immune response against MeV neurovirulence.     We performed microarrays on whole brain tissues in mice to obtain an unbiased picture of how hsp70 alters host innate responses to viral infection.     Hsp70-overexpressing transgenic (TG) and non-transgenic (NT) mice were infected with MeV intracranially, and total brain mRNA harvested at 5 and 10 days post infection (d.p.i.) was analyzed, sampling the hemisphere opposite the side of viral inoculation.     Analysis includes 6 groups: infected TG at 5 d.p.i. (n=4), infected TG at 10 d.p.i. (n=5), infected NT at 5 d.p.i. (n=4), infected NT at 10 d.p.i. (n=5), uninfected TG at 5 d.p.i. (n=4), and uninfected NT at 5 d.p.i. (n=4).
 E-GEOD-4193 - Transcription profiling of mouse germline during spermatogenesis reveals X and Y occupy a novel compartment in the post-meiotic spermatid and adopt a non-Rabl configuration In mammals, the X and Y chromosomes are subject to meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) during prophase I in the male germline, but their status thereafter is currently unclear.     An abundance of X-linked spermatogenesis genes has spawned the view that the X must be active [1-8]. On the other hand, the idea that the imprinted paternal X of the early embryo may be pre-inactivated by MSCI suggests that silencing may persist longer [9-12]. To clarify this issue, we establish a comprehensive X-expression profile during mouse spermatogenesis.     Here, we discover that the X and Y occupy a novel compartment in the post-meiotic spermatid and adopt a non-Rabl configuration.     We demonstrate that this post-meiotic sex chromatin (PMSC) persists throughout spermiogenesis into mature sperm and exhibits epigenetic similarity to the XY body.     In the spermatid, 87% of X-linked genes remain suppressed post-meiotically, while autosomes are largely active.     We conclude that chromosome-wide X-silencing continues from meiosis to the end of spermiogenesis and discuss implications for proposed mechanisms of imprinted X-inactivation.     Independent germ cell preps were used for array analysis.     Duplicates were provided for each sample.
 E-GEOD-24786 - Evaluation of the effect of antimiR-122 administration on the liver, spleen and heart miRNome To determine the effect of antimiR-122 administration on the mouse miRNome.     To functionally investigate a possible link between miR-122 and iron metabolism we inhibited miR-122 by a single, intraperitoneal injection of Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA)-modified antimiR oligonucleotides into age- and sex-matched C57Bl/6 WT mice.     To inhibit miR-122 specifically, we injected an antimiR compound with perfect complementarity to miR-122 [perfect match (PM); PM antimiR-122]. As negative controls, mice were either injected with an LNA control compound with two mismatches (2MM, 2MM antimiR-122) or the vehicle control (SAL; 0.9% NaCl). Mice were sacrificed three and six weeks after injection.     Independent of treatment, mice were viable and exhibited no overt physical or behavioral abnormalities.     To exclude that PM antimiR-122 administration disturbs the expression of other miRNAs we analyzed miRNA expression profiles in the livers, hearts and spleens of the same mice.
 E-GEOD-10082 - Transcription profiling of mouse liver from wild-type or genetically deleted AHRs were treated with corn oil vehicle or TCDD reveals aryl hydrocarbon receptor regulates distinct dioxin-dependent and dioxin-independent gene batteries Conventional biochemical and molecular techniques identified previously several genes whose expression is regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). We sought to map the complete spectrum of AHR-dependent genes in male adult liver using expression arrays to contrast mRNA profiles in Ahr-null mice (Ahr–/–) with those in mice with wild-type AHR (Ahr+/+). Transcript profiles were determined both in untreated mice and in mice treated 19 h earlier with 1000 µg/kg 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Expression of 456 ProbeSets was significantly altered by TCDD in an AHR-dependent manner, including members of the classic AHRE-I gene battery, such as Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, Cyp1b1, and Nqo1. In the absence of exogenous ligand, AHR status alone affected expression of 392 ProbeSets, suggesting that the AHR has multiple functions in normal physiology.     In Ahr–/– mice, only 32 ProbeSets exhibited responses to TCDD, indicating that the AHR is required for virtually all transcriptional responses to dioxin exposure in liver.     The flavin-containing monooxygenases, Fmo2 and Fmo3, considered previously to be uninducible, were highly induced by TCDD in an AHR-dependent manner.     The estrogen receptor alpha as well as two estrogen-receptor-related genes (alpha and gamma) exhibit AHR-dependent expression, thereby extending cross-talk opportunities between the intensively studied AHR and estrogen receptor pathways.     p53 binding sites are over-represented in genes down-regulated by TCDD, suggesting that TCDD inhibits p53 transcriptional activity.     Overall, our study identifies a wide range of genes that depend on the AHR, either for constitutive expression or for response to TCDD. Experiment Overall Design: Mice bearing wild-type or genetically deleted AHRs were treated with corn oil vehicle or TCDD, and their livers analyzed by expression arrays.
 E-GEOD-6210 - Transcription profiling by array of mice lacking exons 3 to 4 of the Pgc1beta gene (PGC1beta E3,4-/E3,4- mice) against wild type controls to study the role of PGC1beta in metabolism PGC1beta is a transcriptional coactivator that potently stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration of cells.     Here, we have generated mice lacking exons 3 to 4 of the Pgc1beta gene (PGC1beta E3,4-/E3,4- mice). These mice express a mutant protein that has reduced coactivation activity on a subset of transcription factors, including ERRalpha, a major target of PGC1beta in the induction of mitochondrial gene expression.     The mutant mice have reduced expression of OXPHOS genes and mitochondrial dysfunction in liver and skeletal muscle as well as elevated liver triglycerides.     Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp and insulin signaling studies show that PGC1beta mutant mice have normal skeletal muscle response to insulin, but have hepatic insulin resistance.     These results demonstrate that PGC1beta is required for normal expression of OXPHOS genes and mitochondrial function in liver and skeletal muscle.     Importantly, these abnormalities do not cause insulin resistance in skeletal muscle but cause substantially reduced insulin action in the liver.     Experiment Overall Design: Gene expression levels in liver tissue and quadriceps muscle were compared between WT/Control and PGC1beta mutant tissue.     Total RNA was extracted from liver and skeletal muscle using RNAeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.     Synthesis of cRNA, hybridization and scanning of the Affymetrix Murine 430 2.0 chip was performed by Dana Farber Cancer Institute Microarray Core Facility.     The microarray data was analyzed by Clustering Analysis using the d-Chip software (Li and Wong, 2001).
 E-GEOD-13380 - Epigenomic analysis of neonatal dendritic cells in mice with increased allergic susceptibility RATIONALE: In a mouse model of maternal transmission of asthma risk (J. Immunol 170:1683, 2003), baby mice of asthmatic (As), but not normal (Nrm), mothers show increased susceptibility to allergy.     We previously showed that adoptive transfer to normal baby mice of dendritic cells (DCs) harvested from asthma-susceptible but allergen-naïve neonates reproduces the increased susceptibility to asthma.     Hence, the maternal effect is mediated by altered neonatal DCs, which skew immune responses towards a pro-allergic Th2 phenotype.     To identify potential molecular mechanisms, we performed epigenomic profiling of isolated neonatal DCs. METHODS: BALB/c mice were sensitized by 2 i.p. injections of ovalbumin (OVA) in alum and repeatedly challenged with OVA aerosols (As) prior to mating with normal males.     Purified splenic CD11c+ DCs of 14-day old allergen-naïve offspring from these As and control Nrm mothers were isolated using magnetic beads.     Methylation profiles of genomic DNA were obtained using Switchgear epigenomic chip arrays.     After normalization and background correction analysis using significance analysis for microarrays (SAM) and ANOVA was performed.     RESULTS: We identified 300 to 6000 (depending on stringency) chromosomal regions with significantly different methylation status, (2 – 10 fold). Clustering methods and pathway analysis identified several interrelated gene groups that merit further study.     CONCLUSION: Maternal asthma causes multiple significant epigenetic changes in neonatal dendritic cells.      Keywords: Dendritic cells, genomic DNA, DNA methylation, allergy, asthma The analysis includes 9 samples of genomic DNA from isolated splenic CD11c+ dendritic cells ( 95% pure) per group.     The two groups are neonates born to mothers with induced allergy to ovalbumin, and normal control neonates.     All neonates are genetically and environmentally identical, and allergen-naive.

 E-GEOD-7091 - Transcription profiling of mouse liver to identify hepatic genes differentially expressed in the presence of the maslinic acid in olive oil Two olive oils only differing in the presence of maslinic acid were prepared.     Using DNA microarrays, hepatic gene expression was analysed in apoE-deficient mice with a C57BL/6J genetic background  Experiment Overall Design: The experimental animals were 12, two-month old, female, homozygous apoE KO mice with a C57BL/6J genetic background.     Experiment Overall Design: Two study groups were established: a) one received a chow diet (Teklad Mouse/Rat Diet no. 2014, Harlan Teklad, Harlan Ibérica, Barcelona, Spain) supplemented with 10% (w/w) olive oil (diet OO) (n=6), and b) the other received the same chow diet but supplemented with 10% (w/w) maslinic acid- enriched olive oil (diet MAOO; n= 6 and).
 E-GEOD-24368 - Distinct Early Molecular Responses to Mutations Causing vLINCL and JNCL Presage ATP Synthase Subunit c Accumulation in Cerebellar Cells Variant late-infantile (vLINCL) and juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL) share clinical and pathological features, including lysosomal accumulation of mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit c, but the unrelated CLN6 and CLN3 genes may initiate disease via similar or distinct cellular processes.     To gain insight into the NCL pathways, we established murine wild-type and vLINCL CbCln6nclf cerebellar cells and compared them to wild-type and JNCL CbCln3∆ex7/8 cerebellar cells.     CbCln6nclf/nclf cells and CbCln3∆ex7/8/∆ex7/8 cells both displayed abnormally elongated mitochondria and reduced cellular ATP levels and, as cells aged to confluence, exhibited accumulation of subunit c protein in Lamp 1-positive organelles.     However, at sub-confluence, endoplasmic reticulum PDI immunostain was decreased only in CbCln6nclf/nclf cells, while fluid-phase endocytosis and LysoTracker labeled vesicles were decreased in both CbCln6nclf/nclf and CbCln3∆ex7/8/∆ex7/8 cells, though only the latter cells exhibited abnormal vesicle subcellular distribution.     Furthermore, unbiased gene expression analyses revealed only partial overlap in the cerebellar cell genes and pathways that were altered by the Cln3∆ex7/8 and Cln6nclf mutations.     Thus, these data support the hypothesis that vLINCL and JNCL mutations trigger distinct processes that converge on a shared pathway, which is responsible for proper subunit c protein turnover and neuronal cell survival.     Genotype comparison.     3 replicates each of CD1 wild-type cells, CD1 Cln3 mutant cells, C57BL6 wild-type cells, and C57BL6 Cln6 mutant cells.
 E-GEOD-33248 - MMS toxicogenomics collaboration Affymetrix data In order to screen candidate genes that discriminate genotoxic hepatocarcinogens from nongenotoxic ones, we compared gene expression in the liver of mice treated with 6 genotoxic hepatocarcinogens or 5 nongenotoxic hepatocarcinogens.     6 genotoxic and 2 non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogens with expression time of 4h, 20h, 14 days, and 28 days
 E-GEOD-8150 - Transcription profiling of mouse brain to identify age-related transcriptional changes and the effect of dietary supplementation of vitamin E We established the transcriptional profile of brain aging and examine the global effects of vitamin E supplementation on age-related alterations in expression in the aged mouse brain.     Experiment Overall Design: Gene expression profiles were obtained from the neocortex tissues of 5-month-old controls, 30-month-old controls and 30-month old B6C3F1 mice with middle age-onset supplementation of alpha-tocopherol or a mixture of alpha and gamma-tocopherol (500mg/kg of each tocopherol).
 E-GEOD-36068 - The Disruption of Celf6, a Gene Identified by Translational Profiling of Serotonergic Neurons, Results in Autism-Related Behaviors The immense molecular diversity of neurons challenges our ability to deconvolve the relationship between the genetic and the cellular underpinnings of neuropsychiatric disorders.     We suspected that comprehensive approaches to parsing this complexity may inform human genetics studies.     The serotonergic system has long been suspected in disorders that involve repetitive behaviors and resistance to change, including autism.      We generated a bacTRAP mouse line to permit the in vivo profiling of all ongoing translation in serotonergic neurons.     From this, we identified 174 serotonergic-cell enriched and specific genes, including all known markers of these cells.      Analysis of common variants in these genes in human families with autism implicated two genes, C1QTNF2 and the RNA-binding protein CELF6. This work provides a reproducible and accurate method to assess the translational profiles of serotonergic neurons under a variety of conditions in vivo, and suggests cell-specific information may provide some insight into the genetic etiology of complex psychiatric disorders For each cell population, three independent TRAP replicates were collected, and total RNA from both the immunoprecipitate and unbound fractions were seperately amplified and hybridized.     For each tissue, several representative unnbound fractions are provided to serve as controls.      Biological replicates are GCRMA normalized within groups.     Following averaging of replicates, we recommend further global normalization between groups, using affymetrix biotinylated controls, to correct for any broad biases in scanning and hybridization.     Finally for many analyses, we also recommend filtering to remove those probesets with low IP/UB fold change values from each cell type(see PMID:20962086). Researchers can contact us for spreadsheets where these additional steps have been completed.
 E-GEOD-45941 - Transcription factor TFAP2C regulates major programs required for murine fetal germ cell maintenance and haploinsufficiency predisposes to teratomas in male mice Maintenance and maturation of primordial germ cells is controlled by complex genetic and epigenetic cascades, and disturbances in this network lead to either infertility or malignant aberration.     Transcription factor Tcfap2c / TFAP2C has been described to be essential for primordial germ cell maintenance and to be upregulated in several human germ cell cancers.     Using global gene expression profiling, we identified genes deregulated upon loss of Tcfap2c in primordial germ cell-like cells.     We show that loss of Tcfap2c affects many aspects of the genetic network regulating germ cell biology, such as downregulation maturation markers and induction of markers indicative of somatic differentiation, cell cycle, epigenetic remodeling, and pluripotency associated genes.     Chromatin-immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated binding of Tcfap2c to regulatory regions of deregulated genes (Sfrp1, Dmrt1, Nanos3, c-Kit, Cdk6, Cdkn1a, Fgf4, Klf4, Dnmt3b and Dnmt3l) suggesting that these genes are direct transcriptional targets of Tcfap2c in primordial germ cells.     Since Tcfap2c deficient primordial germ cell like cells display cancer related deregulations in epigenetic remodeling, cell cycle and pluripotency control, the Tcfap2c-knockout allele was bred onto 129S2/Sv genetic background.     There, mice heterozygous for Tcfap2c develop germ cell cancer with high incidence.     Precursor lesions can be observed as early as E16.5 in developing testes displaying persisting expression of pluripotency markers.     We further demonstrate, that mice with a heterozygous deletion of the Tcfap2c target gene Nanos3 are also prone to develop teratoma.     These data highlight Tcfap2c as a critical and dose-sensitive regulator of germ cell fate.     8 samples were analyzed.     Ctrl ESC:     Control mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), 2 biological rep KO ESC:       Tcfap2c knock-out mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), 2 biological rep Ctrl PGC:     Control mouse primordial germ cells (PGCs), 2 biological rep KO PGC:       Tcfap2c knock-out  mouse primordial germ cells (PGCs), 2 biological rep
 E-MEXP-3820 - Transcription profiling by array of mouse wild type and NFAT2 knock out follicular helper CD4 T cells and non follicular helper CD4 T cell populations Comparatative gene expression analysis for wild type and NFAT2-/- CD4 T cell subsets including follicular helper CD4+ T (TFH) cells, activated CD4+ T cells, and naive CD4+ T cells isolated from the spleen.
 E-GEOD-38136 - Hepatic gene expression in BALB/c mice fed a quercetin diet We showed that diets containing 0.1% or 0.5% quercetin lowered the STZ-induced increase in blood glucose levels and improved plasma insulin levels.      A cluster analysis of the hepatic gene expressions showed that 0.5% quercetin diet suppressed STZ-induced alteration of gene expression.      Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the quercetin diets had their greatest suppressive effect on the STZ-induced elevation of expression of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21(WAF1/Cip1) (Cdkn1a). In this experiment, we determined the effect of quercetin on healthy control BALB/c mice that were fed the AIN93G diet containing 0, 0.1, 0.5 or 1% quercetin for 2 weeks.     GSEA and one-way ANOVA did not detect any significant changes in hepatic gene expression in normal mice as a result of a quercetin diet.      Using a linear modeling approach and the empirical Bayes statistics, we found that Ubc were significantly reduced by both the 0.5% and 1% quercetin.     Six-week-old male mice were divided into 4 groups of 6 mice each, housed in groups of 3 per cage, and fed a standard purified AIN-93G diet containing 0% (Control), 0.1% (0.1), 0.5% (0.5), or 1% quercertin  (1.0) for 2 weeks.
 E-GEOD-4675 - Transcription profiling by array of mouse pre-frontal cortex at different time-points after birth Abnormal development of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is associated with a number of neuropsychiatric disorders that have an onset in childhood or adolescence.     Although the basic laminar structure of the PFC is established in utero, extensive remodeling continues into adolescence.     To map the overall pattern of changes in cortical gene transcripts during post-natal development, we made serial measurements of mRNA levels in mouse PFC using oligonucleotide microarrays.     We observed changes in mRNA transcripts consistent with known post-natal morphological and biochemical events.     Overall, most transcripts that changed significantly showed a progressive decrease in abundance after birth, with the majority of change between post-natal weeks 2 and 4. Genes with cell proliferative, cytoskeletal, extracellular matrix, plasma membrane lipid / transport, protein folding, and regulatory functions had decreases in mRNA levels.     Quantitative PCR verified the microarray results for six selected genes: DNA methyltransferase 3A (Dnmt3a), procollagen, type III, alpha 1 (Col3a1), solute carrier family 16 (monocarboxylic acid transporters), member 1 (Slc16a1), MARCKS-like 1 (Marcksl1), nidogen 1 (Nid1) and 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (heart, mitochondrial) (Bdh). Keywords: time course, development, mRNA expression Single-channel affymetrix arrays were used to profile mRNA expression in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of male mice at different time-points after birth (post-natal).  Each array is an independent animal.
 E-GEOD-58722 - Checkpoint blockade immunotherapy relies on T-bet but not Eomes to induce effector function in tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells Coinhibitory receptor blockade is a promising strategy to boost immunity against a variety of human cancers.     However, many patients still do not benefit from this treatment, and responders often experience immune-related toxicities.     These issues highlight the need for improved understanding of checkpoint blockade, but the T cell-intrinsic signaling pathways and gene expression profiles engaged during treatment are not well defined, particularly for combination approaches.     We utilized a murine model of CD8+ T cell tolerance to address these issues.     We used microarrays to examine the global transcriptional response of T cells rendered tolerant in vivo by encounter with tumor/self-antigen versus T cells activated in response to an immunogenic tumor.     RNA isolated from naive Gag-specific T cells was compared to RNA isolated from T-cells transferred into B6 mice with established FBL tumor (immune) and from Alb:Gag mice (tolerant). Two days after T cell transfer, recipient spleen and lymph nodes were harvested and pooled.     Transferred cells were then sorted based on CD8+ CD90.1+ CD69hi to a  96% purity using a FACSAria III (BD Biosciences).  There were 3 biological replicates per condition.
 E-GEOD-43928 - Expression data from TNF-stimulated mouse glomeruli The specific contribution of the two TNF-receptors Tnfr1 and Tnfr2 to TNF-induced inflammation in the glomerulus is unknown.     In mice, TNF exposure induces glomerular expression of inflammatory mediators like adhesion molecules and chemokines in vivo, and glomerular accumulation of leukocytes.     To examine Tnfr-specific inflammatory responses in intrinsic glomerular cells but not infiltrating leukocytes we performed microarray gene expression profiling on intact glomeruli isolated from wild-type and Tnfr-deficient mice following TNF exposure in vitro.     Glomeruli were isolated from male C57BL/6J wild-type and Tnfr-deficient mice applying a magnetic bead-based isolation technique.     Isolated intact glomeruli were stimulated with TNF for 12 hours in vitro for subsequent RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
 E-GEOD-22871 - Expression data from wild-type and PPARalpha-null mice exposed to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) and a persistent environmental contaminant found in the tissues of humans and wildlife.      Although blood levels of PFOS have begun to decline, health concerns remain because of the long half-life of PFOS in humans.     Like other PFAAs, such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), PFOS is an activator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARα) and exhibits hepatocarcinogenic potential in rodents.      PFOS is also a developmental toxicant in rodents where, unlike PFOA, it’s mode of action is independent of PPARα.  Wild-type (WT) and PPARα-null (Null) mice were dosed with 0, 3, or 10 mg/kg/day PFOS for 7 days.      Animals were euthanized, livers weighed, and liver samples collected for histology and preparation of total RNA.  Gene profiling was conducted using Affymetrix 430 2 microarrays.      In WT mice, PFOS induced changes that were characteristic of PPARα transactivation including regulation of genes associated with lipid metabolism, peroxisome biogenesis, proteasome activation, and inflammation.      PPARα-independent changes were indicated in both WT and Null mice by altered expression of genes related to lipid metabolism, inflammation, and xenobiotic metabolism.      Such results are similar to prior studies done with PFOA and are consistent with modest activation of the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and possibly PPARγ and/or PPARβ/δ.  Unique treatment-related effects were also found in Null mice including altered expression of genes associated with ribosome biogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation and cholesterol biosynthesis.     Of interest was up-regulation of Cyp7a1, a gene which is under the control of various transcription regulators.      Hence, in addition to its ability to modestly activate PPARα, PFOS induces a variety of “off-target” effects as well.      PPARalpha-null and wild-type male mice at 6-9 months of age were dosed by gavage for 7 consecutive days with either 0, 3, or 10 mg/kg PFOS (potassium salt) in 0.5% Tween 20.   Five biological replicates consisting of individual animals were included in each dosage group.      Data were compared to results previously published by our group for PFOA and Wy-14,643, a commonly used agonist of PPARalpha (Rosen et al., Toxicol Pathol.     36:592-607, 2008; GSE9796)
 E-GEOD-43775 - Induction of the mouse germ cell fate by transcription factors in vitro [exp1] The germ cell lineage ensures the continuity of life through the generation of male and female gametes, which unite to form a totipotent zygote.     We have established a culture system that recapitulates the mouse germ-cell specification pathway: Using cytokines, embryonic stem cells (ESCs)/induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are induced into epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) and then into primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs) with capacity both for spermatogenesis and oogenesis, creating an opportunity for understanding and regulating mammalian germ cell development in both sexes in vitro.     Here we show that, without cytokines, simultaneous over-expression of three transcription factors (TFs), Blimp1 (also known as Prdm1), Prdm14 and Tfap2c (also known as AP2γ), directs EpiLCs, but not ESCs, swiftly and highly efficiently into a PGC state with endogenous transcription circuitry.     The induction of the PGC state on EpiLCs minimally requires Prdm14 but not Blimp1 or Tfap2c. The TF-induced PGC state reconstitutes key transcriptome and epigenetic reprogramming in PGCs, but bypasses a mesodermal program that accompanies PGC specification in vivo and in vitro by cytokines including BMP4. Importantly, the TF-induced PGC-like cells robustly contribute to spermatogenesis and fertile offspring.     Our findings provide not only a novel insight into the transcriptional logic that creates a germ cell state, but also a foundation for the TF-based reconstitution and regulation of mammalian gametogenesis.     Aim of this analysis is characterization of transcription factor-induced primordial germ cells (TF-PGCLCs) compared with cytokine-induced primordial germ cells (Ck-PGCLCs) (Hayashi et al., 2011, Cell), epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) (Hayashi et al., 2011, Cell), and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and identification of genes differentially expressed among them.     TF-PGCLCs induced by multiple combinations of TFs (Blimp1 (B), Prdm14 (P14), and Tfap2c (A) (BP14A), BP14, P14A, P14) on day 2 and 4 (for BP14A cells) of the induction were also compared.     Parental clone without exogenous TFs cultured with doxycycline, are also included as a negative control.     Ck-PGCLCs day 2 and day 4 samples, which are previously unreported, EpiLCs and ESCs used in this study were also included.     Overexpression of exogenous three TFs in ESCs yields stella-ECFP (SC) positive cells, which were sorted and included in the analysis.     cDNA samples, prepared from approximately 20,000 cells, were amplified with a quantitative global PCR method (Kurimoto et al., 2006, Nucleic Acids Research). Two biological duplicates for each cell type were analyzed.     Samples from GSE30056 were also included and reanalysed (GSM1070855-GSM1070864).
 E-GEOD-27516 - Preclinical Models for Neuroblastoma: Establishing a Baseline for Treatment Here we characterize and optimize both systems to increase their utility for preclinical studies.     We show that TH-MYCN mice develop tumors in the paraspinal ganglia, but not in the adrenal, with cellular and gene expression patterns similar to human NB. In addition, we present a new ultrasound guided, non-invasive orthotopic xenograft method.     This injection technique is rapid, provides accurate targeting of the injected cells and leads to efficient engraftment.     We also demonstrate that tumors can be detected, monitored and quantified prior to visualization using ultrasound, MRI and bioluminescence.     Finally we develop and test a “standard of care” chemotherapy regimen.     This protocol, which is based on current treatments for neuroblastoma, provides a baseline for comparison of new therapeutic agents.     A total of 17 samples are provided reprsenting TH-MYCN tumors derived from mice
 E-GEOD-18586 - Saturated fat stimulates obesity and hepatic steatosis and affects gut microbiota composition by an enhanced overflow of dietary fat to the distal intestine We studied the effect of dietary fat type, varying in polyunsaturated/saturated fatty acid ratio's (P/S) on development of metabolic syndrome.     C57Bl/6J mice were fed purified high-fat diets (45E% fat) containing palm oil (HF-PO; P/S 0.4), olive oil (HF-OO; P/S 1.1) or safflower oil (HF-SO; P/S 7.8) for 8 weeks.     A low-fat palm oil diet (LF-PO; 10E% fat) was used as a reference.     Additionally, we analyzed diet-induced changes in gut microbiota composition and mucosal gene expression.     The HF-PO diet induced a higher body weight gain and liver triglyceride content compared to the HF-OO, HF-SO or LF-PO diet.     In the intestine, the HF-PO diet reduced microbial diversity and increased the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio.     Although this fits a typical obesity profile, our data clearly indicate that an overflow of the HF-PO diet to the distal intestine, rather than obesity itself, is the main trigger for these gut microbiota changes.     A HF-PO diet-induced elevation of lipid metabolism-related genes in the distal small intestine confirmed the overflow of palm oil to the distal intestine.     Some of these lipid metabolism-related genes were previously already associated with the metabolic syndrome.     In conclusion, our data indicate that saturated fat (HF-PO) has a more stimulatory effect on weight gain and hepatic lipid accumulation than unsaturated fat (HF-OO and HF-SO). The overflow of fat to the distal intestine on the HF-PO diet induced changes in gut microbiota composition and mucosal gene expression.     We speculate that both are directly or indirectly contributive to the saturated fat-induced development of obesity and hepatic steatosis.       Keywords: Diet intervention study Nine-week-old C57Bl/6J mice were fed a low-fat diet (LF-PO) and three different types of high-fat diet, based on palm oil (HF-PO; P/S1.0), olive oil (HF-OO; P/S4.6) and safflower oil (HF-SO; P/S10.1) for 8 weeks.     Body weight was recorded weekly and after 7 weeks of diet intervention an oral glucose tolerance test was performed.     After 2 weeks of diet intervention, 6 mice per high-fat diet group were anaesthetized with a mixture of isofluorane (1.5%), nitrous oxide (70%) and oxygen (30%) and the small intestines were excised.     Adhering fat and pancreatic tissue were carefully removed.     The small intestines were divided in three equal parts along the proximal to distal axis (SI 1, SI 2 and SI 3) and microarray analysis was performed on mucosal scrapings.
