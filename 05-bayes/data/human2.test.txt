 E-GEOD-41605 - Decoding human cytomegalovirus using ribosome profiling The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) genome was sequenced 20 years ago.     However, like other complex viruses, our understanding of its protein coding potential is far from complete.     Here, we use ribosome profiling and transcript analysis to experimentally define the HCMV translation products and follow their temporal expression.     We identified several hundred previously unidentified open reading frames and confirmed a fraction by mass spectrometry.     We found that regulated use of alternative transcript start sites plays a broad role in enabling tight temporal control of HCMV protein expression and allowing multiple distinct polypeptides to be generated from a single genomic locus.     Our results reveal an unanticipated complexity to the HCMV coding capacity and illustrate the role of regulated changes in transcript start sites in generating this complexity.     Ribosome profiling and mRNA-seq from 3 time points (5hr, 24hr, 72hr) along HCMV infection.      The supplementary file 'GSE41605 merlin final orfs.bed.gz' includes the 751 ORFs of HCMV that were identified in this study.

 E-GEOD-33149 - Substrate selectivity for semisynthetic CK2 proteins with various posttranslational modifications Protein Ser/Thr kinase CK2 is involved in a myriad of cellular processes including cell growth and proliferation by phosphorylating hundreds of substrates, yet the regulation process of CK2 function is poorly understood.      The CK2 catalytic subunit, CK2α, is modified by O-GlcNAc on Ser347 proximal to a Cdk1 phosphorylation site at Thr344 on the same protein.      The substrate selectivity for protein kinase CK2 was examined by performing kinase assays on protein microarrays spotted with 17,000 human proteins.      Semisynthetic CK2α proteins were prepared to contain an unmodified C-terminal tail, S-GlcNAc-Serine at S347, or Pfa (non-hyrdolyzeable phosphomimic) at T344.  These semisynthetic proteins were used to determine if the posttranslational modifications on CK2 alpha modulate the substrate selectivity for this pleiotropic kinase.     The different semisynthetic CK2α proteins were tested alone and in the presence of the regulatory subunit CK2β since it is known that the CK2α subunit is active both in its isolated state and in the heterotetrameric state formed in the presence of the regulatory beta subunit.      The CK2β subunit has been shown to modulate CK2 activity with some substrates and not others.     In the study presented here, kinase assays were performed using three different semisynthetic CK2 alpha proteins: unmodified C-terminal tail; S-GlcNAc-Ser at 347; and Pfa (phosphomimic) at 344.  The semisynthetic proteins were each tested alone and in the presence of the regualatory CK2 beta subunit.      There were six different kinase conditions and each condition was performed in duplicate and one no kinase control was performed to eliminate autophorylated proteins.
 E-GEOD-33150 - Substrate selectivity for semisynthetic CK2 proteins with Pin1 Protein Ser/Thr kinase CK2 is involved in a myriad of cellular processes including cell growth and proliferation by phosphorylating hundreds of substrates, yet the regulation process of CK2 function is poorly understood.      The CK2 catalytic subunit, CK2α, is phosphorylated at Thr344 and phosphorylation on the C-terminal tail of CK2α is required for interaction with Pin1 protein.      The substrate selectivity for protein kinase CK2α was examined by performing kinase assays on protein microarrays spotted with 17,000 human proteins.      Semisynthetic CK2α proteins were prepared to contain an unmodified C-terminal tail or phospho-Thr (pThr) at T344.  These semisynthetic proteins were used to determine if the phosphorylation-dependent interaction of CK2α with Pin1 can modulate the substrate selectivity for CK2. The different semisynthetic CK2α proteins (unmodified and pThr344) were tested alone and in the presence of the recombinant Pin1 protein.      Pin1 has been shown to interaction with CK2α only when CK2α is phoshorylated on its C-terminal site (including Thr344). In the study presented here, kinase assays were performed using two different semisynthetic CK2α proteins: unmodified C-terminal tail and phospho-Thr (pThr) at 344.     The semisynthetic proteins were each tested alone and in the presence of the recombinant Pin1 protein.      There were four different kinase conditions and each condition was performed in duplicate.
 Pettigrew et al 2015 We screened 86 children with language impairment and/or a family history of dyslexia for copy number variation (CNV). Participants were recruited as part of a longitudinal family study to investigate language and reading development in early childhood, and were assessed over a period of approximately 5 years. DNA was genotyped on an Illumina Human OmniExpress-24 platform, and CNVs predicted using QuantiSNP and PennCNV. Reported CNVs span at least three consecutive genetic variants, have a confidence score   10, and were predicted by both algorithms.
 E-GEOD-2785 - How different diets alter skeletal muscle in pig we want to test how different diets (high energy diet HED and low energy diet LED) alter muscle methabolism in pigs.     we perform different array experiments using an human platform (GPL2011) and RNA extracted from pig skelethal muscle.     thank's this we also test cross-species hybridisation.     extraction of RNA from pig skeletal muscle by a modification of Chomczynski protocol.      cDNA was purified and labelled with Cy3 and Cy5 fluorochromes using the cDNA labeling purification module kit (Invitrogen). The HED samples were analysed in comparison to LED samples, used as reference.     The labelled cDNA were appropriately coupled and used for competitive hybridisation on the same microarray at 42°C for 16h. The relative intensity of labelled cDNA in HED and LED was acquired with ScanArray LITE scanner (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc).  platform used for our experiments is GPL2011.

 E-GEOD-14709 - Transcriptional profile of B. theta and E. rectale growing in the cecum of mice fed different diets The adult human gut microbial community is typically dominated by two bacterial phyla (divisions), the Firmicutes and the Bacteroidetes.     Little is known about the factors that govern the interactions between their members.     Here we examine the niches of representatives of both phyla in vivo.      Finished genome sequences were generated from E. rectale and E. eligens, which belong to Clostridium Cluster XIVa, one of the most common gut Firmicute clades.     Comparison of these and 25 other gut Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes indicated that the former possess smaller genomes and a disproportionately smaller number of glycan-degrading enzymes.     Germ-free mice were then colonized with E. rectale and/or a prominent human gut Bacteroidetes, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, followed by whole genome transcriptional profiling of both organisms in their distal gut (cecal) habitat as well as host responses, high resolution proteomic analysis of cecal contents, and biochemical assays of carbohydrate metabolism.     B. thetaiotaomicron adapts to E. rectale by upregulating expression of a variety of polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) encoding numerous glycoside hydrolase gene families, and by signaling the host to produce mucosal glycans that it, but not E. rectale, can access.     E. rectale adapts to B. thetaiotaomicron by decreasing production of its glycan-degrading enzymes, increasing expression of selected amino acid and sugar transporters, and facilitating glycolysis by reducing levels of NADH, in part via generation of butyrate from acetate, which in turn is utilized by the gut epithelium.     This simplified model of the human gut microbiota illustrates niche specialization and functional redundancy within members of major gut bacterial phyla, and the importance of host glycans as a nutrient foundation that ensures ecosystem stability.      We assessed how E. rectale and B. thetaiotaomicron were affected by changes in host diet.     Groups of age- and gender-matched co-colonized mice were fed one of three diets that varied primarily in their carbohydrate and fat content: (i) the standard low-fat, plant polysaccharide-rich diet used for the experiments described above (abbreviated ‘LF/PP’ for low-fat/plant polysaccharide), (ii) a high-fat, ‘high-sugar’ Western-type diet (abbreviated HF/HS) that contained sucrose, maltodextrin, corn starch as well as complex polysaccharides (primarily cellulose) that were not digestible by B. thetaiotaomicron or E. rectale, and (iii) a control diet that was similar to (ii) except that the fat content was 4-fold lower (‘LF/HS’ for low-fat, high-sugar; n=5 mice per group).
 E-GEOD-14737 - Characterizing a model human gut microbiota composed of members of its two dominant bacterial phyla The adult human gut microbial community is typically dominated by two bacterial phyla (divisions), the Firmicutes and the Bacteroidetes.     Little is known about the factors that govern the interactions between their members.     Here we examine the niches of representatives of both phyla in vivo.

This simplified model of the human gut microbiota illustrates niche specialization and functional redundancy within members of major gut bacterial phyla, and the importance of host glycans as a nutrient foundation that ensures ecosystem stability.      The interactions between E. rectale and B. thetaiotaomicron were characterized by performing whole genome transcriptional profiling of each species after colonization of gnotobiotic mice with each organism alone, or in combination.     E. rectale was also profiled during in vitro growth.

 E-GEOD-46557 - Interactions of wheat aleurine and plant omega-3 fatty acids on the rat gut microbiota Microbiota from rats fed with wheat aleurone and plant omega fatty acids In this study we investigated how an AX-rich WA and ALA from linseed oil (LO) modulate the gut microbiota of rats.     Wistar rats were fed a standard diet and received either an iso-energetic control oil (PO), control oil + aleurone (A+PO), linseed oil (LO) or linseed oil + aleurone (A+LO) during 12 weeks.     Feacal samples were recovered after the 12 week treatments.     DNA extractions were performed using using the Qiagen's DNA Stool Kit (Qiagen, West Sussex, UK). 10ng of DNA template were amplified by PCR (16S gene) and purified using Qiagen's Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, West Sussex, UK). 1ug of purified PCR product were labelled with either Cy3 or Cy5 using Genomic DNA ULS Labelling kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). 250ng of labelled DNA were hybridized on the microarray for 24h at 65°C. Washings were performed as recommended by the manufacturer.     Microarray scanning was performed on a Surescan Microarray scanner (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Data were extracted using the Feature extraction software (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The retained intensity value for each probe was the ratio between the spot’s median intensity signals and the median of background signals.     A 13 chip study was realized to analyze the feacal microbiota of rats treated with either an iso-energetic control oil (PO), control oil + aleurone (A+PO), linseed oil (LO) or linseed oil + aleurone (A+LO) during 12 weeks.     Each microarray corresponding to hybridization with 250ng of labelled 16S rRNA gene amplicons from 2 rat DNA faecal samples.     Microbiota structure and diversity were assessed using the HuGChip (Tottey et al., 2013). Each probe (4441) was synthetized in three replicates.     On the same array, 2 different samples were hybridized.     One labelled with the Cy3 dye and one with the Cy5 dye.     The results were processed as single channel (13 raw data files available on Series records for 25 samples).

 E-GEOD-34966 - Chronic colitis in Bacteroides Thetaiotaomicron-Monoassociated HLA-B27 Transgenic rats alters expression of receptor and metabolic genes in luminal bacteria. Background: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) may be caused in part by aberrant immune responses to commensal intestinal microbes including Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (B.theta).  Healthy, germ-free HLA-B27 transgenic (Tg) rats develop chronic colitis when colonized with complex gut commensal bacteria whereas non-transgenic (nTg) rats remain disease-free.       However, the role of B.theta, a well-characterized anaerobic commensal bacterium, in causing disease in Tg rats is unknown nor is much known about how microbes respond to host inflammation.      Methods: Tg and nTg rats were monoassociated with a human isolate of B.theta.     Colonic inflammation was quantified by blinded histological scoring and real-time RT-PCR assays of pro-inflammatory cytokines.     Cecal bacterial concentrations were measured by quantitative plating.      Whole genome transcriptional profiling of B.theta recovered from ceca was performed using custom GeneChips and data analyzed using dChip, Significance Analysis of Microarrays, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) software.      Results: B.theta monoassociated Tg rats had significantly more colonic inflammation and increased colonic levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNAs compared to nTg controls.      Transcriptional profiles of cecal B.theta were significantly different in Tg vs. nTg rats.      GSEA revealed that the Gene Ontology molecular function of receptor activity, which is comprised mainly of genes that encode nutrient binding proteins, was significantly enriched with genes upregulated in B.theta from Tg rats.     KEGG canonical pathways of ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation, pyrimidine metabolism, purine metabolism, peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and metabolism were significantly enriched with genes downregulated in B.theta from Tg rats.      Numbers of viable bacteria/gram cecal contents in Tg vs. nTg rats were not significantly different.      Conclusions: B.theta induces mild colitis in HLA-B27 Tg rats, which is associated with changes in the expression of microbial metabolic and nutrient binding pathways, but no difference in concentrations of luminal bacteria.     Mechanistic studies of differentially expressed B.theta genes may reveal novel pathways that contribute to IBD. The fully-sequenced human fecal isolate of B.theta (VPI-5482) was grown on Brain-Heart Infusion (BHI) agar and in BHI broth under strict anaerobic conditions using pre-reduced media.     Adult germ-free HLA-B27/b2 microglobulin transgenic rats and adult germ-free non-transgenic littermate were monoassociated with B.theta for six weeks in gnotobiotic isolators at the National Gnotobiotic Rodent Resource Center at UNC Chapel Hill.     Bacterial RNA was isolated from rat cecal contents and hybridized on Affymetrix human gut microbiota community GeneChip.
 E-GEOD-46677 - Differentiation of a human gut microbiota in an improved three-stage continuous culture model of the human large intestine under anaerobia generated by the bacteria A three-stage continuous fermentative system was developed to simulate and control physicochemical factors of the gut biology.     Inoculation was of each reactor was performed from a human fecal sample which was initially amplified with a batch procedure.     Samples from the initial feces, the batch and from the bioreactors media were collected to extract bacterial DNA. 16S PCR amplification was performed to assess the microbial diversity at the family level using the HuGChip.     Amplified DNA was purified and labelled with either Cy3 or Cy5 dye and hybridized on the microarray.     A 5 chip study was realized, each corresponding to hybridization with 250ng of labelled 16S rRNA gene amplicons from either the initial stool, the batch inoculum or fermentative medium different compartments of the simulated colon (Proximal, Transversal and Distal). Each probe (4441) was synthetized in three replicates.

 E-GEOD-65455 - Characterizing the interactions between a naturally-primed IgA (mAb 260.8) and its conserved Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron species-specific epitope in gnotobiotic mice [array] Comparisons of gnotobiotic Rag1-/- mice, with and without subcutaneous 260.8 hybridomas, disclosed that this IgA does not affect B. thetaiotaomicron population density or suppress 260.8 epitope production but does affect bacterial gene expression in ways that are emblematic of a diminished host innate immune response.     C57BL/6 wildtype, C57BL/6J Rag1-/- , and C57BL/6J Rag1-/- mice harboring the 260.8 IgA producing hybridoma were colonized for 10 days with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482.
 E-GEOD-25572 - Depolymerization of plant cell wall glycans by symbiotic human gut bacteria (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron) Symbiotic bacteria inhabiting the distal human gut have evolved under intense pressure to utilize complex carbohydrates, predominantly plant cell wall glycans abundant in our diets.     These substrates are recalcitrant to depolymerization by digestive enzymes encoded in the human genome, but are efficiently targeted by some of the ~103-104 bacterial species that inhabit this niche.     These species augment our comparatively narrow carbohydrate digestive capacity by unlocking otherwise unusable sugars and fermenting them into host-absorbable forms, such as short-chain fatty acids.     We used phenotype profiling, whole-genome transcriptional analysis and molecular genetic approaches to investigate complex glycan utilization by two fully sequenced and closely related human gut symbionts: Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Bacteroides ovatus.     Together these species target all of the common glycosidic linkages found in the plant cell wall, as well as host polysaccharides, but each species exhibits a unique ‘glycan niche’: in vitro B. thetaiotaomicron targets plant cell wall pectins in addition to linkages contained in host N- and O-glycans; B. ovatus uniquely targets hemicellulosic polysaccharides along with several pectins, but is deficient in host glycan utilization.     Growth of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron in vitro in minimal medium plus different purified complex glycans.     Observation of increased gene expression was used to determine genes that are involved in metabolism of each glycan.     Two biological replicates each.

 E-GEOD-62638 - Expression data from ZBP1-expression and ZBP1 nonexpression breast tumors. ZBP1/IMP1 is an mRNA binding protein that post-transcriptionally regulates the expression of a handful mRNAs, implicated in maintaining cell polarity and adhesion.     We have previously shown that ZBP1 was able to inhibit proliferation and invasiveness of breast carcinoma cells in vitro.     In the current study, we utilized orthotopic breast fat pad xenografts to further investigate the ZBP1-mediated functions in breast tumorigenesis and metastasis in vivo.     We used microarrays to identify important gene for breast tumor growth and metastasis in response to ZBP1 expression Total RNA was extracted from breast tumor generated from ZBP1-expression and ZBP1-nonexpression MDA231 cells and used for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.     We sought to obtain gene expression profiles from the individual tumors and identify what genes are up-regulated or down-regulated in the presence of ZBP1. The microarray experiments and data analysis were performed in 'Gene Company Limited' in Senzheng, China.     G-10 and G-13, Tumors generated from MDA231/GFP cells; I-5 and I-6, tumors generated from MDA231/ZBP1-GFP cells.

Here, cynomolgus macaques were exposed to 0, 2, and 6 ppm formaldehyde for 6 hours/day across two consecutive days.     RNA was extracted from the nasal maxilloturbinate region, a direct target of formaldehyde inhalation exposure.     Genome-wide miRNA expression levels were assessed using microarrays.     Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) were exposed to 0, 2 and 6 ppm formaldehyde for 6 hours/day across two consecutive days using whole body exposure chambers.

 E-GEOD-25415 - Transcription analysis of wild-type and chuR Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron genes in the mouse cecum The large-scale application of genomic and metagenomic sequencing technologies has yielded a number of insights about the metabolic potential of symbiotic human gut microbes.     Bacteria that colonize the mucosal layer that overlies the gut epithelium have access to highly-sulfated polysaccharides (i.e., mucin oligosaccharides and glycosaminoglycans), which they could potentially forage as nutrient sources.     To be active, sulfatases must undergo a critical post-translational modification catalyzed in anaerobic bacteria by the AdoMet enzyme anSME (anaerobic Sulfatase-Maturating Enzyme). In the present study, we have tested the role of this pathway in the prominent gut symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, which possesses more predicted sulfatases (28) than in the human genome and a single predicted anSME. In vitro studies revealed that deletion of its anSME (BT0238) results in loss of sulfatase activity and impaired ability to use sulfated polysaccharides as carbon sources.     Co-colonization of germ-free animals with both isogenic strains, or invasion experiments involving the introduction of one then the other strain, established that anSME activity and the sulfatases that are activated via this pathway, are important fitness factors for B. thetaiotaomicron, especially when mice are fed a simple sugar diet that requires this saccharolytic bacterium to adaptively forage on host glycans as nutrients.     Whole genome transcriptional profiling of wild-type and the anSME mutant in vivo revealed that loss of this enzyme alters expression of genes involved in mucin utilization and that this disrupted ability to access mucosal glycans likely underlies the observed dramatic colonization defect.     Comparative genomic analysis reveals that 100% of 46 fully sequenced human gut Bacteroidetes contain homologs of BT0238 and genes encoding sulfatases, suggesting that this is an important and evolutionarily conserved feature.     Three replicate samples from 4 different biological treatment groups: 1. Wild-type B. thetaiotaomicron from the cecum of gnotobiotic mice fed a simple-sugar diet; 2. chuR mutant B. thetaiotaomicron from the cecum of gnotobiotic mice fed a simple-sugar diet; 3. Wild-type B. thetaiotaomicron from the cecum of gnotobiotic mice fed a plant-rich diet; 4. chuR mutant B. thetaiotaomicron from the cecum of gnotobiotic mice fed a plant-rich diet.
 E-GEOD-25575 - Depolymerization of plant cell wall glycans by symbiotic human gut bacteria (Bacteroides ovatus) Symbiotic bacteria inhabiting the distal human gut have evolved under intense pressure to utilize complex carbohydrates, predominantly plant cell wall glycans abundant in our diets.     These substrates are recalcitrant to depolymerization by digestive enzymes encoded in the human genome, but are efficiently targeted by some of the ~103-104 bacterial species that inhabit this niche.     These species augment our comparatively narrow carbohydrate digestive capacity by unlocking otherwise unusable sugars and fermenting them into host-absorbable forms, such as short-chain fatty acids.

Together these species target all of the common glycosidic linkages found in the plant cell wall, as well as host polysaccharides, but each species exhibits a unique ‘glycan niche’: in vitro B. thetaiotaomicron targets plant cell wall pectins in addition to linkages contained in host N- and O-glycans; B. ovatus uniquely targets hemicellulosic polysaccharides along with several pectins, but is deficient in host glycan utilization.     Bacteroides ovatus bacteria were grown either in vitro on defined complex glycan sources, or in vivo in the intestinal tract of gnotobiotic mice fed variable diets.     Increased in vitro gene expression was used to indicate the genes required for metabolism of complex glycans and compared to in vivo transcriptional activity to determine expression in the mouse gut.

 Vogler et al 2010 In this study a cross-population microarray-based map of copy-number variant regions (CNVRs) was generated. We used the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 to scan the genomes of 1167 individuals from two ethnically distinct populations (Europe, N = 717; Rwanda, N = 450). Three different CNV-finding algorithms were tested and compared for sensitivity, specificity, and feasibility. Two algorithms were subsequently used to construct CNVR maps, which were also validated by processing subsamples with additional microarray platforms (Illumina 1M-Duo BeadChip, Nimblegen 385K aCGH array) and by comparing our data with publicly available information.

 E-GEOD-51760 - Development and validation of a microarray for the investigation of the CAZymes encoded by the human gut microbiome Distal gut bacteria play a pivotal role in the digestion of dietary polysaccharides by producing a large number of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) that the host otherwise does not produce.     We report here the design of a high density custom microarray that we used to spot non-redundant DNA probes for more than 6,500 genes encoding glycoside hydrolases and lyases selected from 174 reference genomes from distal gut bacteria.     The custom microarray was tested and validated by the hybridization of bacterial DNA extracted from the stool samples of lean, obese and anorexic individuals.     Our results suggest that a microarray-based study can detect genes from low-abundance bacteria better than metagenomic-based studies.     A striking example was the finding that a gene encoding a GH6-family cellulase was present in all subjects examined, whereas metagenomic studies have consistently failed to detect this gene in both human and animal gut microbiomes.     In addition, an examination of eight stool samples allowed the identification of a corresponding CAZome core containing 46 families of glycoside hydrolases and polysaccharide lyases, which suggests the functional stability of the gut microbiota despite large taxonomical variations between individuals.     Fecal samples were collected from eight female subjects.     Three were obese subjects of BMI kg m-2: 35, 46.8 and 51.3, respectively; age: 42, 21 and 65 years old, respectively.     Three were anorexic women of BMI kg m-2: 9.8, 10 and 13.7, respectively; age: 19, 23 and 49 years old, respectively.     Finally, two fecal samples from lean women of BMI kg m-2: 18.6 and 23.42 were analyzed.
 E-GEOD-14958 - IgM Abs to Apoptosis-associated Determinants recruit C1q and enhance dendritic cell phagocytosis of apoptotic cells Natural antibodies, which arise without known immune exposure, have been described that specifically recognize cells dying from apoptosis but their role in innate immunity remains poorly understood.     Herein, we show that the immune response to neo-antigenic determinants on apoptotic thymocytes is dominated by antibodies to oxidation-associated antigens, phosphorylcholine (PC), a head group that becomes exposed during programmed-cell death, and malondialdehyde (MDA), a reactive aldehyde degradation product of polyunsaturated lipids produced following exposure to reactive-oxidation species.     While natural antibodies to apoptotic cells in naïve adult mice were dominated by PC and MDA specificities, the amounts of these antibodies were substantially boosted by treatment of mice with apoptotic cells.     Moreover, the relative amounts of PC and MDA antibodies was affected by VH gene inheritance.     Antibody interactions with apoptotic-cells also mediated the recruitment of C1q, which alone can promote apoptotic-cell phagocytosis by immature dendritic cells.     Significantly, IgM-antibodies to both PC and MDA were primary factors in determining the efficiency of serum-dependent apoptotic-cell phagocytosis.     Hence, we demonstrate a mechanism by which certain natural antibodies that recognize neo-antigens on apoptotic cells, in naïve mice and those induced by immune exposure to apoptotic-cells, can enhance the functional capabilities of immature dendritic cells for phagocytic engulfment of apoptotic cells.      Keywords: Natural antibodies, Inflammation, Complement, Apoptosis In the study presented here, a total of 11 custom-spotted protein slides were hybridized with a T15 IgM monoclonal antibody at three different concentrations, an isotype control IgM, 2 slides were hybridized with serum from naїve mice, 2 slides incubated with serum from mice immunized with apoptotic cells, 2 slides were incubated with serum from mice immunized with saline, and a negative control slide with no antibody hybridized
 E-GEOD-2393 - Transcription profiling of rhesus monkeys through HIV disease progression and impact on neuroAIDS. The virus/host interactions during the acute phase of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection help determine the course of disease.     During this time period, virus enters the brain.     Here, we report clusters of genes whose transcripts are significantly upregulated in the frontal lobe of the brain during acute simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of rhesus monkeys.     Many of these genes are involved in interferon (IFN) and/or interleukin (IL)-6 pathways.     Although neither IFNa nor IFN? are elevated in the brain, IL6 is increased.     Both IFNa and IL6 are elevated in plasma during this acute phase.     The upregulation of STAT1, verified by immunohistochemical staining, can be due to both central nervous system (CNS) (SIV and IL6) and peripheral (IFNa and IL6) causes, and can itself drive the expression of many of these genes.     Examination of the levels of expression of the upregulated genes in the post-acute and long-term phases of infection, as well as in SIV encephalitis, reveals increased expression throughout SIV infection, which may serve to protect the brain, but can have untoward long-term consequences.

 de Smith et al 2007 The discovery of copy number variation in healthy individuals is far from complete, and owing to the resolution of detection systems used, the majority of loci reported so far are relatively large ( approximately 65% 10 kb). Applying a two-stage high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization approach to analyse 50 healthy Caucasian males from northern France, we discovered 2208 copy number variants (CNVs) detected by more than one consecutive probe. These clustered into 1469 CNV regions (CNVRs), of which 721 are thought to be novel. The majority of these are small (median size 4.4 kb) and most have common boundaries, with a coefficient of variation less than 0.1 for 83% of endpoints in those observed in multiple samples. Only 6% of the CNVRs analysed showed evidence of both copy number losses and gains at the same site. A further 6089 variants were detected by single probes: 48% of these were observed in more than one individual. In total, 2570 genes were seen to intersect variants: 1284 in novel loci. Genes involved in differentiation and development were significantly over-represented and approximately half of the genes identified feature in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database. The biological importance of many genes affected, along with the well-conserved nature of the majority of the CNVs, suggests that they could have important implications for phenotype and, thus, be useful for association studies of complex diseases.
 Mokhtar et al 2014 Copy number variation (CNV) has been recognized as a major contributor to human genome diversity. It plays an important role in determining phenotypes and has been associated with a number of common and complex diseases. However CNV data from diverse populations is still limited. Here we report the first investigation of CNV in the indigenous populations from Peninsular Malaysia. We genotyped 34 Negrito genomes from Peninsular Malaysia using the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 microarray and identified 48 putative novel CNVs, consisting of 24 gains and 24 losses, of which 5 were identified in at least 2 unrelated samples. These CNVs appear unique to the Negrito population and were absent in the DGV, HapMap3 and Singapore Genome Variation Project (SGVP) datasets.
 E-GEOD-23969 - Tumor bearing mice: One group was caged in 24-hour light cycle (L/L), the other group was caged in 12-hour light/dark cycle (L/D) Abnormal circadian rhythms, including exposure to light at night, are associated with a higher cancer risk and a poorer prognosis, which may be one of the reasons that the incidence of cancer is increasing in individuals subjected to these stresses.     However, the molecular or systemic mechanisms involved in tumor growth under artificial illumination stress conditions have not been identified.     In fact, the question of whether artificial illumination stress promotes tumor growth at all is still controversial.     To identify the possible mechanisms underlying tumor progression related to circadian rhythms, we set up nude mouse xenograft models.     Eight-week-old male nude mice (BALBc nu/nu) were injected with 100ul (1x106 cells) of Hela cells suspension at two separate dorsal sites.     Mice were randomly caged (5/cage) and subdivided into L/L (24-hour light cycle; circadian rhythm disruption model) and L/D (12-hour light/dark cycle; normal circadian rhythm model) groups.     11days after injection, we sacrificed one L/L mouse and one L/D mouse, tumors were immediately preserved using liquid nitrogen.     Total RNA from tumors were isolated using QIAshredder and RNeasy-Mini kits (Qiagen). We compared the transcriptional profiling of L/L tumor which was derived from  24-hour light cycle (L/L) caging mice with the transcriptional profiling of L/D tumor which was derived from 12-hour light/dark cycle (L/D) caging mice.
 E-GEOD-14969 - Regulation of dendritic cells and macrophages by an anti-apoptotic cell natural Ab that inhibits inflammatory arthritis Although natural antibodies (NAbs) are present from birth, little is known about what drives their selection, and whether they have housekeeping functions.     We now show that the prototypic T15-NAb, first identified because of its protective role in infection, is representative of a previously unknown type of NAb response that specifically recognizes and forms complexes with apoptotic cells, and which promotes cell-corpse engulfment by phagocytes.     This T15-NAb-mediated process is dependent on the recruitment of C1q and mannose-binding lectin (MBL), which have known immune modulatory activities that also provide “eat me” signals for phagocytic clearance.     Further investigation revealed that, the addition of T15-NAb significantly suppressed in vitro macrophage LPS-induced TNF-alpha and IL-6 secretion, as well as in vitro Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced dendritic cell maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.     Significantly, high doses of this B-1 cell produced NAb also inhibited in vivo TLR–induced pro-inflammatory responses, and could suppress autoimmune inflammatory arthritis.     These studies identify and characterize a previously unknown regulatory circuit by which a NAb product of innate-like B cells aids homeostasis by control of fundamental inflammatory pathways.      Keywords: Dendritic cells, Macrophages, Natural Antibodies, Apoptosis, Inflammation, Arthritis In the study presented here, a total of 15 custom-spotted protein slides were hybridized with a T15 IgM monoclonal antibody at three different concentrations, an isotype control IgM, 2 slides were hybridized with serum from naїve mice, 2 slides incubated with serum from mice immunized with apoptotic cells, 2 slides were incubated with serum from mice immunized with saline, 2 slides were incubated with serum from mice injected with T15 IgM monoclonal antibody, 2 slides were incubated with serum from a lupus-prone mouse disease model and a negative control slide with no antibody hybridized
 E-GEOD-11317 - Transcription profiling of mouse model of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer lymph node metastasis. The lymphatic system is a common avenue for the spread of breast cancer cells and dissemination through it occurs at least as frequently as hematogenous metastasis.     Approximately 75% of primary breast cancers are estrogen receptor (ER) positive and the majority of these maintain receptor expression as lymph node (LN) metastases.     However, it is unknown if ER function is equivalent in cancer cells growing in the breast and in the LNs. We have developed a model to assess estrogen responsiveness in ER(+) breast tumors and LN metastases.     Fluorescent ER(+) MCF-7 tumors were grown in ovariectomized nude mice supplemented with estradiol.     Once axillary LN metastasis arose, estradiol was withdrawn (EWD), for 1 or 4 weeks, or continued, to assess estradiol responsiveness.     On EWD, proliferation rates fell similarly in tumors and LN metastases.     However, estradiol-dependent ER down-regulation and progesterone receptor induction were deficient in LN metastases, indicating that ER-dependent transcriptional function was altered in the LN. Cancer cells from estradiol-treated and EWD primary tumors and matched LN metastases were isolated by laser capture microdissection.     Global gene expression profiling identified transcripts that were regulated by the tissue microenvironment, by hormones, or by both.     Interestingly, numerous genes that were estradiol regulated in tumors lost estradiol sensitivity or were regulated in the opposite direction by estradiol in LN metastases.     We propose that the LN microenvironment alters estradiol signaling and may contribute to local antiestrogen resistance.     Experiment Overall Design: 10 samples, including 3 each of estrogen and estrogen withdrawn axillary lymph nodes and 2 each of estrogen and estrogen withdrawn primary mammary gland tumors.

 E-GEOD-30559 - Great Ape Copy Number Variation Intra-specific polymorphism in copy number is documented in many organisms, including human and chimpanzee, but very little is known for other great apes.     This study aims to provide CNVs data for orangutan, gorilla, bonobo and chimpanzee, and compare the CNV patterns among these species, as well as with human CNVs and segmental duplications from public databases.     Each sample is hybridized against a common reference of the same species for two dye combinations (e.g. chimp1 CY5 vs chimpREF Cy3; chimp1 CY3 vs chimpREF Cy5; bonobo1 CY5 vs bonoboREF Cy3; bonobo1 CY3 vs bonoboREF Cy5;)
 E-GEOD-61654 - miRNA profiling of Macaca mulatta intact duodenum samples following chronic Delta9 Tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) treatment to SIV infected rhesus macaques The study describes miRNA expression in intact duodenum following chronic delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) administration to SIV-infected rhesus macaques.     Chronic Δ9-THC administration to uninfected macaques significantly and positively modulated intestinal miRNA expression by increasing the total number of differentially expressed miRNAs from 14 to 60 days post infection (DPI). At 60DPI, ~28% of miRNAs showed decreased expression in VEH/SIV compared to none in the THC/SIV group.     Furthermore, compared to the VEH/SIV group, THC selectively upregulated the expression of miR-10a, miR-24, miR-99b, miR-145, miR-149 and miR-187 previously shown to target proinflammatory molecules.     NOX4, a potent reactive oxygen species  generator was confirmed as a direct miR-99b target.     A significant increase in NOX4+ crypt epithelial cells was detected in VEH/SIV compared to the THC/SIV group.     We speculate that miR-99b-mediated NOX4 downregulation may protect the intestinal epithelium from oxidative stress-induced damage.     Twelve age and weight matched male Indian rhesus macaques were randomly divided into 4 groups.     Group 1 (n=1) received vehicle (1:1:18 of emulphor : alcohol : saline) and no infection.     Group 2 (THC only, n=3) animals received twice daily intramuscular injections of Δ9-THC and no infection.     Group-3 THC/SIV, (n=4) animals received twice daily injections of vehicle and were infected intravenously with 100TCID50 of SIVmac251. Group-4 (VEH/SIV, n=4) animals received twice daily injections of Δ9-THC similar to group 1 for four weeks prior to SIV infection.     Duodenal pinch biopsies were collected before infection and thereafter at 14 and 30 days post infection.     All animals were necropsied at 60 days post SIV infection.     ~100 ng of total RNA was first reverse transcribed and preamplified according to the manufacturer’s recommendation.     microRNA expression profiling was performed using TaqMan ®OpenArray® Human microRNA panels.     Data analysis was performed using ExpressionSuite® software.     Data was normalized to three endogenous controls (RNU44, RNU48 and snoU6). Delta CT values were calculated by subtracting individual miRNA CT values from an average of all three endogenous controls.      Comparisons were made between preinfection and all three treatment groups at 14, 30 and 60 DPI. To determine the effect of chronic THC treatment during SIV infection, comparisons were also made between VEH/SIV and THC/SIV at all three time points.
 E-GEOD-49875 - HuMiChip analysis of Saliva microbiota Human saliva microbiota is phylogenetically divergent among host individuals yet their roles in health and disease are poorly appreciated.     We employed a microbial functional gene microarray, HuMiChip 1.0, to reconstruct the global functional profiles of human saliva microbiota from ten healthy and ten caries-active adults.     Saliva microbiota in the pilot population featured a vast diversity of functional genes.     No significant distinction in gene number or diversity indices was observed between healthy and caries-active microbiota.     However, co-presence network analysis of functional genes revealed that caries-active microbiota was more divergent in non-core genes than healthy microbiota, despite both groups exhibited a similar degree of conservation at their respective core genes.     Furthermore, functional gene structure of saliva microbiota could potentially distinguish caries-active patients from healthy hosts.     Microbial functions such as Diaminopimelate epimerase, Prephenate dehydrogenase, Pyruvate-formate lyase and N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase were significantly linked to caries.     Therefore, saliva microbiota carried disease-associated functional signatures, which could be potentially exploited for caries diagnosis.      The DMFT INDEX (Decayed, Missing, Filled [DMF] teeth index used in dental epidemiology) values are provided for each sample We employed a microbial functional gene microarray, HuMiChip 1.0, to reconstruct the global functional profiles of human saliva microbiota from ten healthy and ten caries-active adults.
 E-GEOD-38386 - Profiling of microRNA expression in lung cancer cells with up-regulation of Zeb1 The Zeb1 transcriptional repressor plays a key role in metastasis through the down-regulation of genes that are strong inducers of epithelial differentiation and inhibitors of stem-ness.     Here we report that Zeb1 controls the expression of numerous oncogenic and tumor suppressive microRNAs (miRs). Zeb1 stimulated pro-migratory cytoskeletal processes by down-regulating miR-34a and activated Rho GTPases through Arhgap1, a Cdc42 GTPase activating protein and novel miR-34a target gene.     Poor-prognosis human lung adenocarcinomas were highly enriched in a cytoskeletal gene signature activated by miR-34a down-regulation.     These findings suggest that Zeb1 regulates a miR network and drives pro-migratory cytoskeletal processes through miR-34a. Microarray-based interrogation of global miR expression changes in a non-metastatic KP cell line (393P) that undergoes EMT and gains invasive and metastatic capabilities following forced Zeb1 expression (393P Zeb1). two group comparison

 E-GEOD-40878 - Expression of the placental transcriptome in fetal growth restriction in the Baboon is Dependent on Fetal Sex Fetal growth restriction (FGR) develops when fetal nutrient availability is compromised and increases the risk for perinatal complications and predisposes for offspring obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease later in life.     Emerging evidence implicates changes in placental function in altered fetal growth and the subsequent development of adult disease.      The susceptibility for disease in response to an adverse intrauterine environment differs distinctly between boys and girls, with girls typically having better outcomes.      Here, we test the hypothesis that regulation of the placental transcriptome by moderate nutrient reduction is dependent on fetal sex.      We used a non-human primate model of FGR in which maternal global food intake is reduced by 30% starting at gestational day (GD) 30. At GD 165 (term = GD 183) placental genome expression profiling was carried out followed by bioinformatics including pathway and network analysis.     Surprisingly, there was no coordinated placental molecular response to decreased nutrient availability when analyzing the data without accounting for fetal sex.     In contrast, female placentas exhibited a highly coordinated response that included up-regulation of genes in networks, pathways and functional groups related to programmed cell death and down-regulation of genes in networks, pathways and functional groups associated with cell proliferation.     These changes were not apparent in the male placentas.     Our data support the concept that female placentas initiate complex adaptive responses to an adverse intrauterine environment, which may contribute to increased survival and better pregnancy outcomes in girls.     Total RNA obtained from 165dGA control female (n=3), control male (n=3), nutrient restricted female (n=3), and nutrient restricted male (n=3) pregnancies.
 E-GEOD-2377 - Transcription profiling of monkey model of neuroAIDS reveals induction of pathogenic sets of genes in macrophages and neurons The etiology of the central nervous system (CNS) alterations after human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, such as dementia and encephalitis, remains unknown.     We have used microarray analysis in a monkey model of neuroAIDS to identify 98 genes, many previously unrecognized in lentiviral CNS pathogenesis, whose expression is significantly up-regulated in the frontal lobe of simian immunodeficiency virus-infected brains.     Further, through immunohistochemical illumination, distinct classes of genes were found whose protein products localized to infiltrating macrophages, endothelial cells and resident glia, such as CD163, Glut5, and ISG15. In addition we found proteins induced in cortical neurons (ie, cyclin D3, tissue transglutaminase, 1-antichymotrypsin, and STAT1), which have not previously been described as participating in simian immunodeficiency virus or HIV-related CNS pathology.     This molecular phenotyping in the infected brains revealed pathways promoting entry of macrophages into the brain and their subsequent detrimental effects on neurons.     These data support the hypothesis that in HIV-induced CNS disease products of activated macrophages and astrocytes lead to CNS dysfunction by directly damaging neurons, as well as by induction of altered gene and protein expression profiles in neurons themselves which are deleterious to their function.
 E-GEOD-2853 - Transcription profiling of liver samples from Macaca fascicularis treated with varying doses of ciprofibrate for 4 or 15 days Liver gene expression was examined in male cynomolgus monkeys treated with ciprofibrate (PPAR-alpha agonist) for 4 days at 400 mg/kg/day and treated for 15 days at 0, 3, 30, 150 or 400 mg/kg/day.      The untreated control group were given only the vehicle (0.5% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose).  Two animals per group were used for the 4 day treatment and four animals per group were used for the 15 day treatment (except the 15 day control group, which had three animals).  Selection of significantly changed probesets was done using Rosetta Resolver and the fold-change and p values as determined by Resolver are given below.      Affymetrix CEL files and MAS5-processed data have been made availabe for convenience.      Note that data processing reported in the Toxicological Sciences manuscript was done using Rosetta Resolver and the treated versus control group fold-change and p-value are appended to the Series entry.      An article has been published in Toxicological Sciences regarding this dataset; the data interpretation was based on the Rosetta Resolver data.       Experiment Overall Design: Groups consisted of (i) vehicle only for 4 days, (ii) 400 mg/kg/day ciprofibrate for 4 days, (iii) vehicle only for 15 days and (iv) 3, 30, 150, or 400 mg/kg/day ciprofibrate for 15 days.
